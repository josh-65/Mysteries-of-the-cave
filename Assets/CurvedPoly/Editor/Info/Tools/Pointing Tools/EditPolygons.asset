    texts:
    - A <b>Filling Algorithm</b> is the way in which Curved Poly <b>Fills</b> polygons
      with a set of triangles, making a Curved Poly to become a Mesh. This algorithms
      can work during runtime, so the Mesh can be generated with a different amount
      of vertices and triangles according to LoDs and tessellation parameters.<b>You
      can assign different algorithm to each polygon, mixing them the way you like.

    - '<b>Cylindric Interpolation</b>: this was originally the first algorithm used
      for curved polys and one of the most light (meaning it takes less time to compute
      the Mesh from Curved Polygons)'

    texts:
    - '<b>Gouraud Schema</b>: this is the simplest schema. It works like Cylindric
      Interpolation, but simplify the way normals are computed (in a way which resemble
      Gouraud Shading)'

    texts:
    - '<b>Edge Surface Schema</b>: a better solution, which was the default choice
      in Curved Poly 1.1 and 1.2. This schema generates good looking Curved Polygons
      in most of the cases. Sometimes, it may generate strange shapes: if this is
      the case, we suggest to fall back to Cylindric Interpolation or Gouraud Schema
      (only on the polygons with bad shapes)'

    texts:
    - '<b>Half Corner Surface</b>: this is our best algorithm at the moment, and the
      default choice for Curved Polys Made with version 1.3. As for Edge Surface Schema,
      you should fall back to Cylindric Interpolation on single polygons when you
      see strange shapes.'
