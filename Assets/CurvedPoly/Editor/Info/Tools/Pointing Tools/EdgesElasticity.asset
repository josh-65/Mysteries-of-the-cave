      scale down when the two vertices of an edge are more distant, and will scale
      up when the two vertices are close.'

    texts:
    - '<b>Elliptic</b>: in elliptic mode, handles will scale with the distance between
      the first and the last vertex of each edge, like proportional, but scaling happens
      in a way which keeps elliptic edges which have an elliptic shape. Technically
      speaking, the scaling factor is measured on the handles directions instead of
      being evaluated from 3D distances.'
