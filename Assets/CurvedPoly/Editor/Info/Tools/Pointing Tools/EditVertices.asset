    - '<b>Vertex Position</b>: when  you change a vertex position, also handles will
      follow it. Elasticities settings are used to control the way handles follow
      the vertex. You can move a vertex either from Curved Poly Inspector or with
      Unity Move Tool'
    - '<b>Editing Normal</b>: when you rotate a vertex, the editing normal is changed
      instead. The editing normal is the normal vector applied on that vertex. If
      a vertex is smooth, all handles will rotate together with the editing normal.'
