<h1 id="intro" class="guidetitle">Introduction</h1>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Poly</b> is a new modeling solution which mixes 3D modeling
	 with 2D techniques. By injecting splines into polygonal meshes, it allows you to build smooth surfaces with a flexible and scalable resolution (Level of Detail). Compared to other methods like NURBS or Subdivision Surfaces, Curved Poly gives you an alternative which is designed to work better for real time computer graphics applications. </p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Poly</b> is built upon an Open Source Project, the <a
	 href="https://www.shadowframework.com">Shadow Framework</a>, which is the result of years
	 of research in the field of surface modeling, and it allows you to render 3D geometries based on the novel <a
	 href="https://www.shadowframework.com/guide/sf/0">Curved Polygons Net</a> model, an extension
	 to the traditional and standard <b>Mesh</b> model. </p>
	<h4 id="concepts" class="guidetitle mt-5">Curved Polygons Nets Basic Concepts</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">The idea to use curved models to shape geometries is definitely not new. If you come from industrial design, you probably know about NURBS or similar solutions. If you instead come from the cinema industry, you probably have some good experience of modeling with Subdivision Surfaces. These solutions are usually good to shape objects, but they may lack the requirements to be used in real time applications. This is the reason why we all still use (mainly) polygons in games.</p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">In the last twenty years there has been a lot of work around the
	 idea that a polygonal mesh can be improved at execution time with some tessellation process, in order to make it more smooth. Many of these techniques are based on GPU hardware tessellation. Unity itself has its own <a
	 href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-SurfaceShaderTessellation.html">integrated solutions</a>.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph" class="guideparagraph"><b>With Curved Poly, I am trying to face
	 the problem from an alternative perspective</b>. Instead of looking for a way to improve a
	 polygonal mesh with curves, I have looked for a way to integrate curves inside the polygonal model itself. A Curved Poly is indeed an extension of a Polygonal Mesh. Common Polygonal Meshes are defined by a set of vertices connected by lines; when a set of lines form a closed loop (usually of 3 or 4 lines), they become a polygon (usually triangles or quads). With Curved Poly I replaced the linear edges between polygons with curved ones. Such curves are weighted Beziér Curves, one of the most standard solutions for curves modeling.</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/CurvedPolyBasics.png"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 1</b>  A Curved Polygons Net (or Curved Poly for simplicity) replace linear edges between polygons with Curved ones.</p>
	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">As in the linear case, a closed loop of edges will generate a polygon which in this case will be curved. I developed a complex interpolation schema which generates a curved surface following the edges contour smoothly, with an evaluation time which can even make sense for real time applications.</p>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Such interpolation schema follows two main steps:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Tessellation of the Edges</b>: each curved edge is converted into a polyline, with more
		 or less lines according to custom parameters which can be assigned at execution time.</li>
		<li><b>Reconstruction of the Curved Polygons</b>: each polygon is built independently based
		 on the shape and on the level of detail of its surrounding edges. Increasing the resolution of one of the edges will automatically increase the resolution of its attached polygons.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">With Curved Poly you get:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>A smooth and flexible modeling system which exploit weighted beziér curves on 3D models to improve your modeling experiences.</li>		<li>Smart geometry files which will lower your memory usage using curves to represent complexity in order to avoid the redundancy coming from storing pre-tessellated objects.</li>		<li>A highly flexible and customizable LoDs system, where you store only one version of your models and you can generate an high number of representation with different Levels of Detail at execution time.</li>	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>Curved Poly</b> is a modeling tool. Models made with
	 <b>Curved Poly</b> can be visualized with my Open Source software, the <a href="https://www.shadowframework.com">Shadow
	 Framework</a>; you don't need to know everything about <b>Curved Polygons Nets</b> to use
	 <b>Curved Poly</b>, and you don't need to install the <a href="https://www.shadowframework.com">Shadow
	 Framework</a> since it's already part of <b>Curved Poly - Shape Editor</b>. That said, if
	 you wish to know more, you will find a much <a href="https://www.shadowframework.com/guide/sf">more
	 detailed explanation of what a Curved Polygons Net is and how it works</a> on the Shadow Framework
	 site.</p>

<div class="w-100 p-2 pt-0">
	

<h1 id="features" class="guidetitle">General Features</h1>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">There is A LOT to say about Curved Polygons Nets. Here you can
	 find a list of all the most interesting features you will find within <b>Curved Poly</b></p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">An extension to classical Meshes</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Polygons Nets</b> are very closed to meshes. They share
	 a lot of aspects with meshes. They have edges and faces, normals and uv coordinates. If you have experience in the field of modeling with polygonal meshes, you already know most of the things which you need to be known to work with <b>Curved
	 Polygons Nets</b>.</p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Low Number of Vertices</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Polygons Nets</b> use a little amount of vertices and
	 a little amount of data compared to meshes. For example, the Sphere model is made with a total of 32 vertices (8 main vertices and 24 handles vertices). It is much less than every polygonal sphere you may have found in your experiences. </p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Scalability</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Polygons Nets</b> must be transformed into polygonal
	 meshes before being rendered, and this can be done at Run-Time. In order to do so, a Level of Detail must be provided. Such Level of Detail contains information about the number of segments and triangles to be used during the process. In this way, you can generate more or less detailed geometries from the same <b>Curved
	 Polygons Nets</b> during execution, depending on your needs. </p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Mixed Models (new!)</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Polygons Nets</b> can (since version 1.1 of the Shape
	 Editor or version 1.0 of Curved Poly Maker) mix linear edges with curved ones. Polygons generated with lines are practically like regular meshes polygons. This allows the generation of optimal models which exploit Curved Poly features only in the part of your mesh that you need.</p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Segmentation</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Within <b>Curved Polygons Nets</b>, each <b>Curved Polygon</b> and each <b>Curved
	 Edge</b> may have applied a different set of geometric settings. For example, edges can be
	 tessellated with a different amount of segments, and Polygons can be assigned different interpolation schemas (which are used to compute the position of vertices inside the polygon). This all work in an adaptive way, so you can take different choices through the model, which will be applied in a smooth way.</p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Elasticity</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Many operators in Curved Poly works with special elasticity feedbacks which define the way the model reacts to transforms. You can choose among 4 different elasticity schemas.</p>	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">UV Coordinates Groups(new!)</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Having a little number of vertices make it much more easy to deal
	 with uv-coordinates assignment. Furthermore, <b>Curved Poly</b> uses a structure called <b>Unwrap
	 Group</b> which keep a set of uv-coordinates together. <b>Unwrap Groups</b> make it even easier
	 any fix you wish to apply to uv-coordinates. </p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">T-Junctions(new!)</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Polygons Nets</b> support T-Junctions, like <b>Nurbs
	 T-Spline</b>. </p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Mixed Polygons Sizes(new!)</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Polygons Nets</b> support models where polygons have
	 a mixed set of sizes. For example you may work using a mix of <b>Curved Triangles</b> and
	 <b>Curved Quads</b>.</p>

<div class="w-100 p-2 pt-0">
	

<h1 id="newversion" class="guidetitle">New features</h1>	

<p class="guideparagraph">There are a lot of new changes if you come from version previous versions. Here a list of the most significant.</p>	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">From v1.1.1 to v1.2</h4>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Runtime API with Open Source Runtime code</b>: we are releasing the code of Runtime
		 modules of Curved Poly (ShadowFrameworkUnity.dll and CPRuntime.dll), which are now Open Source. Find more at <a
		 href="http://www.shadowframework.com">www.shadowframework.com</a> or ask for more at <a href="http://support.mushroomslabs.com/">support.mushroomslabs.com</a></li>
		<li><b>Edges with Fixed Tessellation</b>: from Tessellation Operator, you can now setup edges
		 to have a fixed tessellation, rather than one which change with lods at runtime. Use this to take control other parts of your models you don't want to change at runtime.</li>
		<li><b>Tessellation Level 0</b>: now you can use the special value <b>0</b> in LoDs assets
		 (t:LoDs). When an edge is assigned a tessellation <b>0</b>, it becomes hidden. Exploit this
		 to take control other parts of your models which should be cut from some Level of Detail. (For instance: if you have a bottle with a little cup, you may want the cup to be cut from the model when it's seen from some distance.)</li>
		<li><b>LoDs preview window</b>: there is now a window to preview your model on all available
		 LoDs; you can use this to keep control other the amount of verts and triangles generated on each Level of Detail. You shall also use this to control the appearance of models where you are using <b>Edges
		 with Fixed Tessellation</b> and <b>Tessellation Level 0</b>.</li>
		<li><b>Compression Modes</b>: you can now control the precision with which data is stored in
		 a Curved Poly Asset.</li>
		<li><b>Custom Settings for Generated Meshes</b>: you can ask Curved Poly to use a set of generated
		 meshes which you can refer throughout your project; this replaces the default behavior which creates new meshes directly at runtime. You can use this if you want to use Curved Poly in junction with other tools which works on meshes at runtime. </li>
		<li><b>Support for Colliders</b>: Curved Poly can now recompute colliders on the model both
		 in edit or runtime mode.</li>
		<li><b>Support for Tangents</b>: Curved Poly can now calculate tangents on the model both in
		 edit or runtime mode.</li>
		<li><b>Support for UV2</b>: Curved Poly can now assign uv2 on the model both in edit or runtime
		 mode. Check the Mesh Mode options in Curved Poly Inspector chapter.</li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">From v1.1 to v1.1.1</h4>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Settings</b>: a totally new section in Curved Poly Inspector.</li>
		<li><b>Scene View Menus Visibility</b>: you can now hide (or show) Menus from Scene View. This
		 settings is an Editor Settings, meaning that it should persist through different models and different projects. </li>
		<li><b>Editor Window</b>: you can now choose to open an editor window where menus will be shown,
		 so that you don't have to keep them in the scene view if you don't like. </li>
		<li><b>Full support for PBR Materials</b>: you can now use all Curved Poly tools with the the
		 High Definition Render Pipeline or Lightwave render Pipeline. Curved Poly will use a different set of materials for that pipelines if you set this in the Settings. </li>
		<li><b>Fixed and issue with UV used at runtime</b>: in this release a bug was fixed which was
		 related to the way UV coordinates was stored in runtime assets. All models with this issue have been corrected and will now show properly at runtime. </li>
		<li><b>Full working recovery system from runtime Data to Edit Data</b>: you may miss the connection
		 between a Curved Poly editing file and a Curved Poly runtime file. The way Curved Poly editing file (t:EditablePolygonsNetData) are regenerated from runtime files (t:CurvedPolyAsset) have been significantly reworked. </li>
		<li><b>Support for Unity versions since 2017.4LTS</b></li>
		<li><b>Support for Unity version since 2019.3 and first check for 2020 alpha</b></li>
		<li><b>Fixed an issue related with system scaling</b>: If your scene view editor menu didn't
		 appear, it was related to a system scaling issue. You should now be able to see the menu. Now you can also remove the menu from the scene, and open the equivalent editor window. </li>
		<li><b>Fixed an issue with Unity Rect Tool</b>. You can now access scene view menus correctly
		 while the Rect tool is active. You still can't use it to transform elements or selections. </li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">From v1.0 to v1.1</h4>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Almost one hundred of new shapes and premade models</b>: Curved Poly project is growing.
		 In the Shape Editor you will find now a big set of additional shape to start with. All these shapes were made with <a
		 href="http://www.curvedpoly.com/article/cppages/cpmaker">Curved Poly Maker</a>. </li>
		<li><b>Curved Poly Geometries</b>: now you can find Curved Poly models made of more geometries.
		 Each geometry map to a different submesh in the final computed mesh, so it can be assigned a different materials. A bounch of new shapable sample models have been added to the project to show this new feature.</li>
		<li><b>Added a new set of template sample models</b> you can use the way you were using primitives.</li>
		<li>We have <b>improved</b> the way in which <b>Curved Polys</b> are <b>stored in your scene
		 view</b>. In version 1.0, the last computed mesh on any Curved Poly was stored together with
		 the scene, affecting the size of the scene itself. Now the mesh is never stored, and it's always recomputed at runtime, making Curved Poly to work at runtime as intended.</li>
		<li><b>Curved Poly Assets</b> now have a dedicated inspector. Read the all new <a href="#assetsandlibraries">Assets
		 And Libraries</a> section for details</li>
		<li><b>Now you can collect more Curved Poly Assets</b> into a <b>Curved Poly Assets Libraries</b>.
		 A new sample models galleries have been added to the project using this feature. This is very useful for the shape editor, you can now collect all the shaped parts of a complex model into one file. Read the all new <a
		 href="#assetsandlibraries">Assets And Libraries</a> section for details.</li>
		<li><b>Visibility Buttons</b>: Now visibility buttons will keep their settings when you switch
		 from one operator to the other. You can still have different settings on different Scene Views if you use more than one. <b>Some
		 settings are automatically assigned if an operator requires that settings to work correctly</b>.
		 </li>
		<li><b>Grow Throw Quads</b> is a new powerful Selection tool, similar to Grow Throw Alignments
		 and available on all Operators.</li>
		<li><b>Pivot in Selection Mode</b>: now you can edit the Pivot used in selection mode to apply
		 transform to your selections; the pivot is still the center of the selection by default, but you can move it directly in the menu or switching to Pivot Mode: exploit it to take control of rotations and scaling on your selected parts </li>
		<li><b>Better Edge Normals Editing</b>: the way in which edge normals are updated when you
		 move vertices has been significantly improved. The new system now takes into account both the axis settings (edge normal vs axis normal) and also user assignments made in the Pointings Operator, making the normal to change smoothly across transform.</li>
		<li><b>Balance Normal Mode</b> is a new Edge Normal function which is available in almost all
		 instruments together with Edge Normal and Axis Normals. Balance Normal has been designed to calculate the correct normal on spheres, but works well also in other situations. </li>
		<li><b>Edge Hints</b>: you can now change edge hints using Pointings Operator (when an edge
		 is selected).</li>
		<li><b>Elasticities</b>: now if you change elasticity mode in Select Operator or Pointings
		 Operator the shape of elements nearby the ones you are moving will be recomputed instantly, so that you can easily try out every elasticity mode or fall back to no elasticity.</li>
		<li><b>Curved Poly Statistics (Curved Poly Inspector)</b>: the panel has been improved. Now
		 you can see differences between the edit model and runtime model ( on unwrapped model some vertices and edges may be duplicated and their amount may differ ). </li>
		<li><b>History (Curved Poly Inspector)</b>: you can now control how much undo steps are cached
		 in the history. Default is 400. You can reduce this if you think Curved Poly is using too much memory resources. </li>

	<p class="guideparagraph">A new Game Object is created with a <b>Curved Poly</b> Behavior,
	 plus a <b>MeshFilter</b> and a <b>Mesh Renderer</b>; the renderer is automatically set up
	 with a material of convenience with a color schema which shows normals direction (such material is called <b>Bisided
	 Normal Mat</b> and you can find it at <b>Curved Poly/Assets/Materials</b> in your project).
	 You should also be able to see the Curved Poly - Shape Editor interface directly in your Scene View. The yellow mushroom <img

	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Poly - Shape Editor</b> uses a huge amount of tools which
	 are directly available in the Scene View. There are a total of three areas you need to check:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>(1)Operators</b>: click on one of the these buttons to change the way you can interact
		 with your model. You can have more Scene Views opened at once, and you can use a different operator in each view.</li>
		<li><b>(2)Visibility Settings Buttons</b>: toggle buttons to show/hide different controls on
		 the scene, allowing you to hide useless controls depending on your needs.</li>
		<li><b>(3)Dynamic Menus</b> the bottom of the Scene View will contain many items, depending
		 on the <b>active Operator and Visibility Buttons</b>. Some of the contents in this areas may
		 even change after some of user actions. Refer to each Operator documentation page to know more about this area.</li>
	</ul>
	 Curved Poly Scene View Interface structure. <b>(1)Operators</b>, <b>(2)Visibility Settings
	 Buttons</b>, <b>(3)Dynamic Menus</b>.
	

<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> In Scene View Menu, all buttons and controls are drawn on a specific Menu Layer. When the user mouse over buttons or control panels, Curved Poly will change its interaction state, in order to avoid conflicts with the Scene View. For example: you can't, accidentally, point on a vertex behind a control panel while you interact with the control panel. In order to make this clear, you will see that some in-scene controls change their appearance once you mouse over Menu items. </p>	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Editor Window</h4>

<p class="guideparagraph">The following buttons are available on almost all Curved Poly operators (sometimes, they maybe uneffective, depending on user choices). The settings will change if you change view or operator; when you get back to an operator you have already used in a specific view, your previous settings will be restored.

		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/handleshandles.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Handles</b>:
		 shows handles, on vertices or on curves. Usually you need to click on a vertex or on a curved to access its handles. Since each curved edge starts from a vertex, ends with another vertex and has two handles, one for each vertex, clicking on a curved edge will shows its two handles. Clicking on a vertex, will show one handle for each curved edges which uses that vertex on one of its extremes.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/weightshandles.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Handles

	<h4 id="selectactions" class="guidetitle mt-5">Common Menu Actions</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> Like other modeling softwares, <b>Curved Poly</b> allows you to
	 select more elements (vertices, edges or faces) to work on them at the same time. The following menu actions are used to control which elements are selected; they are always available from any Operator (excluded the <b>GameObjects
	 Operator</b>):</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/selectall.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Select

		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/unselectall.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Unselect
		 All</b>: Unselect any selected Edge, Polygon or Vertex. Activated also by pressing Shift+S
		 on the KeyBoard.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/growselection.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Grow</b>:
		 extends the selection to any Edge, Polygon or Vertex being nearby one the currently selected vertices. If you are in Pointing Operator and your selection is empty the selection will be extended starting from the last element clicked.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/growthroughalignments.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Grow Through Alignments</b>: extends the selection to any edge being
		 aligned to one of the already selected edge (or, for Pointing Operator, to an edge which was previously clicked). It also selects any vertex at the extremes of each edge. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/growthroughquads.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Grow
		 Through Quads (new!)</b>: extends the selection from an edge to its adjacent curved quads.
		 The process is iterated more times if there are more successive quads forming a strip. An advice: the first time you try this, it's better if you select one edge at a time; then, after you have understood how it works, you may try more complex selections. This action is used to fast select strips of polygons through regular shapes like cylinders. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/extendtoedges.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Extend
		 to Edges</b>: extends the selection to any Edge being nearby one the currently selected vertices.If

<h1 id="operatorsviews" class="guidetitle">Operators and Views</h1>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Curved Poly Shape Editor comes with four different operators, each one changing the way you can interact with your model.</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/transformoperator.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>GameObjects Operator</b>: The GameObjects Operator is the default
		 Operator and it’s used to access Unity Transforms Tools, which are disabled while using the other operators. While it is active, you can freely move, rotate or scale your GameObject in the scene without the risk of changing the shape of the model. NOTE: while using any other operator, you can activate the GameObjects Operator by pressing ESC. The GameObjects Operator should always be active while you are not editing the shape of a model: having the GameObjects Operator active will allow you easily switch between objects. Indeed, two different Curved Poly may use the same Curved Poly Asset, and in that case they will share the same Operator choice. The difference between Curved Poly and Curved Poly Asset and their full mechanic will be explained in the Curved Poly Inspector section.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/pointingsoperator.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Pointings Operator</b>: The Pointing Operator is used to point on
		 single elements of you models to access their parameters or transform them. While Pointing Operator is active some of the standard behaviours of Unity are disabled: You cannot select another object by clicking on it. This is done to prevent you from selecting other objects while shaping your surface. You have to Click the Hierarchy to select another Object, or activate the GameObjects Operator. The GameObject Transform Tools will be hidden. You can still edit the transform in the Inspector. As an alternative, you can switch to the Transform Operator.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/selectoperator.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Selection
		 Operator</b>: The Selection Operator allows you to edit a group of elements in the model at
		 once. Either vertices, edges or polygons can be selected. Selected elements will always have a different appearance compared to unselected ones. The Selection Tools section will explain all the tools you can use to rework selections.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/tessellationoperator.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Tessellation Operator</b>: this operator is dedicated to tessellation
		 hints on edges. Tessellation hints are used to control how much each edge will be tessellated.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Furthermore: with Curved Poly Maker, you will access another additional
	 8 Operators. 4 are added to the Shape Editor Menu. 5 are added to the all new <img class="backcolor-complement-0"
	 src="images/mkoperators/create.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span>create menu.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/mkoperators/hideOperator.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Hide

		 Helps you automatically fix some issues.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Multiple Views</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">One important thing to know about Operators is that you can have more Operators working at the same time. In order to do this, you need to have more Scene Views opened in the Editor. Then you will be free to assign a different Operator on each one. Curved Poly will remember your separate choice even if you switch to a second object and then you get back to the first one. The first time you open a Scene View, it will always be assigned the default GameObject Operator. Here an example with the Pointing Operator and the Selection Operator active at the same time.</p>

<h1 id="pointingsoperator" class="guidetitle">Pointing Operator</h1>	

<p class="guideparagraph">While Pointing Operator is active, you can edit one single element at a time. Elements can be vertices, handles, edges or (curved) polygons. Each element must be activated before you access its controls. </p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> Activation is usually performed by clicking on the element, but
	 sometimes you have to <b>Ctrl+Click</b>. There are three modes:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/vertexmode.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Vertices</b>:
		 only points controls (little cubes) are shown. Simple click on a point control to activate its vertex, <b>Ctrl+Click</b> (everywhere on their shape) to activate and edge or a polygon.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/edgemode.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Edges</b>:
		 only edges controls (little squares) are shown. Simple click on an edge control to activate the edge, <b>Ctrl+Click</b> (everywhere on their shape) to activate a vertex or a polygon.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/actions/polygonmode.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Polygons</b>:
		 only polygons controls (little squares) are shown. Simple click on a polygon control to activate the polygon, <b>Ctrl+Click</b> (everywhere on their shape) to activate a vertex or an edge. Note: sometimes polygons controls are hidden by the surface. If this is the case, it may help switching <img
		 class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/handlesbehindobjects.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Controls
		 Behind Objects</b> on. </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">So, basically, you choose which ones among vertices, edges and
	 polygons must have their activation handle shown, which only need a single click, and you can <b>Ctrl+Click</b> anywhere on the screen to select something else. This was done to give you some flexibility with activation, while avoiding undesidered misclicking (that could happen if everything was selectable with a single click). In any case, you need to activate first a vertex or an edge to activate any of their handles.</p>

	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">To activate an handle, you need first to activate a vertex or an
	 edge. For this reason, you need to make sure that <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/handleshandles.png"/><b>Handles</b> is enabled, and also you need to have enabled either <img
	 class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/verticeshandles.png"/><b>Vertices</b> or <img

	 also consider enabling <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/weightshandles.png"/><b>Weights</b> if you wish to control the handle weight.</p>
	

<p class="guideparagraph"> An handle can be activated by clicking one of the little white cubes which are shown when a vertex or an edge are already active. Activating a handle will show:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><span style="display: inline-block;width:10px;height:100%" class="backcolor-secondary-2-2">&nbsp;</span><b>The

		<li><span style="display: inline-block;width:10px;height:100%" class="backcolor-primary-0">&nbsp;</span><b>The
		 Roll Control</b>, an arc-shaped arrow which allows you to rotate the handle around the direction
		 of the Editing Normal. Such rotation will not affect the normal or the other handles attached to the vertex. The arrow is available regardless the normal is visible or not.</li>
		<li><span style="display: inline-block;width:10px;height:100%" class="backcolor-complement-2">&nbsp;</span><b>The
		 Pitch Control</b>, an arc-shaped arrow which rotate the handle on the plane it share with

	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> Note: sometimes, two handles on the same vertex may be

While using the little sphere, the weight can be adjusted in the interval [0.2,5.0]. While using the value field, it is can be adjusted in the interval [0.001,9.99]. I decided this while tuning the User Experience on the little sphere.</li>

	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Like other modeling softwares, <b>Curved Poly</b> allows you to
	 select more elements (vertices, edges or polygons) to work on them at the same time. The <b>Selection
	 Operator</b> can be used to select a group of elements and transform them with Unity Selection
	 Tools. </p>
	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Visibility</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">While working with selections, it's of utmost importance to keep control other what is visible and what is not. Selected vertices, edges or polygons will have a different appearance from non selected elements. To improve or customize your the appearance of your selected or unselected contents you can:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Disable the Mesh Renderer on your Game Object</b>: polygons will disappear, but polygons
		 controls will still be visible and polygons will be selectable even if you can't see them. Of course, this will also affect performance. </li>
		<li>Activate/Deactive the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/handlesbehindobjects.png"/> Controls Behind Objects Button
		: when active this will remove Z-Test on curves and vertices controls, making them visible
		 through the object. </li>
		<li>Activate/Deactive the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/verticeshandles.png"/>Vertices,
		 <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/edgeshandles.png"/>Edges or <img
		 class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/polygonshandle.png"/>Polygons options
		: they affect the visibility of both selected or unselected elements. </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>Note</b> : if you have a complex model (like the <b>ChamferBox4x</b> Primitive for instance) and you need a precise selection, you may disable Edges and Polygons and either disable the Mesh Renderer or activate the Controls Behind Objects option. In this way you will find it easier to target the exact vertices you want to be selected, especially while using the instruments specific to the Selection Operators. <b>Generally
	 speaking</b>, you should practice with visibility options, or follow the available tutorials,
	 to learn how and when you can exploit any visibility combination to easily select what you need. </p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Select Operator Specific Instruments</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">In the <b>User Interface and Settings</b> section I have covered
	 <a href="#selectactions"> the selection tools available on all the operators. </a></p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> When the <b>Selection Operator</b> is active you can also drag
	 freely the mouse on the screen to add elements to your selection:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> When the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/circleselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Circular Selector</b>: is active, a circle will be drawn and you will
		 be able to select elements by dragging it on the Scene View. You can also change the size of the circle with the buttons <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> on the keyboard. </li>
		<li> When the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/rectangleselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Rectangular Selector</b>: is active, you can drag on the Scene View
		 a rectangle to change the area of selection. </li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">For both the two selector, you will be able to choose between this two options:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/inclusiveselection.png"/><b>Part</b>:
		 elements will be selected when the circle/rectangle cover even a little part of them. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/exclusiveselection.png"/><b>Full</b>:
		 elements will be selected only when the circle/rectangle cover them entirely. The algorithm here takes into account only the visible part of edges and polygons, so it’s more correct to say that the element is selected when its visible part is covered by the tool. </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>Very Important!!</b>: the Circular and Rectangular
	 Selectors always extends from polygons to edges and from edges to vertices. So, when a polygon is selected, also its edges and vertices are selected. If an edge is selected, also its two vertices are selected.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> After you have selected some elements with one of the selector
	 or with the common buttons, you will be shown a <b>Transform Tool</b> to <b>Move</b>, <b>Rotate</b> or <b>Scale</b> all the elements in the selection at once. In order to switch between Translate, Rotate and Scale you can use the standard buttons in the main Unity Toolbar:</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph w-50 mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">

		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 17</b> Unity Tools Toolbar.</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Translate, Rotate, Scale</b> and the combo <b>Translate+Rotate+Scale</b> are supported. The tool will answer correctly also to your choice about <b>Global</b> or <b>Local</b> transform. The <b>Pivot/Center</b> option is instead ignored.</p>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>Very Important!!</b>: The tools will progressively
	 keep any amount of translation, rotation or scaling you apply to a selection. Adding new elements to the selection will reset the transform. You can also reset the transform on the group (without adding new elements) by pressing <b>Space</b> on your keyboard.</p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Pivot Control</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">The Pivot is the center of a selection, and it's used as a reference
	 point to perform rotations and to scale. By default, it's evaluated as the average position between all vertices in the selection. You can change this by entering <img
	 class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/pivothandle.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span>pivot
	 mode: in this mode you can use the <b>Move Tool</b> to change the position of the pivot. This
	 will be affected by any existent rotation or scale applied to the object (you will see the object move around to fit the new pivot). </p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Select Operator Menu</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Furthermore, the Dynamic Menus section will also contain:</p>	
	<ul>

		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 18</b> Tessellation Operator</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">The <b>Tessellation Operator</b> is very similar to <b>Selection
	 Operator</b>, but it's dedicated to <b>Tessellation Hints</b>. Tessellation Hints are little
	 labels (all the characters from <b>A</b> to <b>P</b>, in alphabetical order) which describe
	 how much segments should be used to tessellate an edge.</p>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> I suggest to change the <b>Shading Mode</b> of your active
	 <b>Scene View</b> from Shaded to <b>Wireframe</b> or <b>Shaded Wireframe</b> to have a better
	 visual feedback on the number of triangles. </p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> Curved Polys tessellation is all about determining how much segments
	 should be used to tessellate each curved edge. Then, the <b>Filling Algorithm</b> on each
	 polygon will do the rest. </p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">The exact number of segments is defined at Run-Time, after a specific
	 Level of Detail as been assigned to the entire model; such Levels of Details are defined inside LoDs tables, which are stored in LoDs Assets. Usually, <b>A</b> means a very little amount of segments (the minimum being 1) and <b>P</b> means an impressive huge amount of segments. For practical purposes, I suggest to use only the hints from <b>B</b> to <b>G</b>,
	 reserving the <b>A</b> hint for special situations in which you only need to have a <b>Placeholder*</b> , and all the Hints after <b>G</b> for rare situations or special uses. </p>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> *When the number of segments on each edge is less then
	 3, there is no practical reason to use <b>Curved Poly</b>, since the <b>Curved Poly</b> model
	 will have more vertices than the final tessellated mesh.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Last but not least. On each edge there are two hints, one for each
	 side. <b>Curved Poly</b> tessellates each edge in a smooth way, using an intermediate amount
	 of segments, in order to have more segments near the smaller hint and more segments near the greater hint. An example of this is shown in the <b>Curved
	 Poly Inspector</b> section.</p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Tessellation Operator Instruments</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">With the tessellation operator you can select any group of edges,
	 but the operator ignore polygons or vertices. After selecting an edge, also its extremes vertices will be selected, but you don't have a way to directly select each single vertex (or each single polygon). As for the <b>Selection
	 Operator</b> you have access to:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> a <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/circleselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Circular Selector</b>: a circle will be drawn and you will be able
		 to select edges by dragging it on the Scene View. You can also change the size of the circle with the buttons <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> on the keyboard. </li>
		<li> a <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/rectangleselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Rectangular Selector</b>: you can drag on the Scene View a rectangle
		 to change the area of selection. </li>
		<li> the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/inclusiveselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Part</b> option: elements will be selected when the circle/rectangle
		 cover even a little part of them. </li>
		<li> the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/exclusiveselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Full</b> option: elements will be selected only when the circle/rectangle
		 cover them entirely. The algorithm here takes into account only the visible part of edges, so it’s more correct to say that the edge is selected when its visible part is covered by the tool. </li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">In this operator you can also change the way selectors will affect the elements:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/tessellation/brushtoselect.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Brush to Select</b>: activate the default behavior for Circular and
		 Rectangular Selectors, which select any element being brushed as explained. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/tessellation/brushtofreeze.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Brush to Freeze Edges</b>: activate the Brush to Freeze Edges, which
		 can be used to freeze an edge so that it doesn't change tessellation with LoD change. This modes activate the <b>Brush
		 LoD</b> setting. See the <a href="#fixedtessellation">subsection on fixed tessellation</a> to know more. </li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">After you have selected a group of edges, you can change their hints in two ways:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li> In the scene view you will find a couple of little spheres on every selected edge. Each
		 sphere has a little label showing the hint for one of the two sides of each edge. Moving the sphere from the center to its extreme vertex will change the hint, from <b>A</b> (near the center of the edge) to <b>P</b> (near the position of the vertex). </li>
		<li> In the Dynamic Menus Section you will find a panel named <b>Edge Hints</b> with 16 buttons,
		 one for each possible hint. Clicking on a button will change the hints for all selected edges at once. The hints from <b>B</b> to <b>G</b> have a bolder font, this is to suggest you to use them the most. (Almost all the demo models are made with this practical choice, for instance). </li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 id="lodsassets" class="guidetitle mt-5">LoDs Assets</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Poly</b> tessellation algorithms are based on a Levels
	 of Detail Matrix which can be customized. Such table is stored in the project with a specific asset called LoDs. You can find the default settings for the LoDs table at <b>Assets/CurvedPoly/LoDs/LoDs</b>.
	 If you open the asset, it should look like this:</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph w-50 mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/LoDs.png"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 19</b> A LoDs table</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Each LoD is a record in the table and you can add how much LoDs
	 you wish with the <b>Add LoD</b> button. On each LoD you will find a set of sixteen integers
	 value from <b>Hint A</b> to <b>Hint P</b>. This is the way values for each hint are provided
	 to the algorithms.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">By default, you will find six clearly understandable LoDs named
	 <b>Close, Near, Normal, Distant, Far</b> and <b>Box</b>. Their values have been set up to
	 be coherent with our tessellation algorithms. That said, for practical situations you will probably choose to use the default settings and limit the use of LoDs only to some values, maybe Near-Normal-Far which is a fair enough choice.</p>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">If you wish to change LoDs records you can:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li> Create your own custom <b>LoDs</b> asset in the <b>Project</b> Panel popup menu or with
		 the Assets Menu selecting <b>Create > Curved Poly > LoDs</b>. </li>
		<li> Add new LoDs with the <b>Add LoD</b> button. Pressing more times the Add LoD will automatically
		 create a set of incremental LoDs values which may be a good starting point. </li>
		<li> Clone a pre-existent LoD with the <b>Clone</b> Button inside the LoD record. </li>
		<li> Clone a pre-existent LoD with doubled values with the <b>Clone(2x)</b> button inside the
		 LoD record. </li>
		<li> Remove any load you don’t wish to use with the <b>Remove</b> button. </li>
		<li> Rename the LoD the way you like. You should always use unique names to make it simple to distinguish them. </li>	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">Below the records of the table you will also find the helpful hint views, which contain the same data organized by hint (the column of the table) and not by LoD (the row of the table).</p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">When you have a <b>LoDs Asset</b> (either the default one or a
	 custom one), you can assign it on your <b>Curved Poly Behaviour</b>.</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph w-50 mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">

	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">The choice above the LoDs Asset will be automatically updated with
	 the list of all available LoDs. Each time you change the LoD, your <b>Mesh</b> will be recalculated
	 with the alternative Tessellation Values. This Mechanic is available both in edit mode and in play mode, since its part of <b>Curved
	 Poly Runtime</b>.</p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">LoDs Assets and Tessellation Hints at work</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Each edge has two Tessellation Hints assigned, one for each side of the edge. In order to understand how they work, I will start from the simple case in which the two values on the edge are the same.</p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Let’s suppose that an edge as been assigned the Hint D on both
	 sides and that the current Curved Poly is using the <b>Default LoDs</b> with the <b>Close
	 LoD</b> active. While pointed in the Pointings Operator the edge should look like this:</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/LoDHintD_PhaseA.png"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 21</b>  Hint D + Hint D, Default Close LoD</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Where I changed the <b>Shading Mode</b> of the <b>Scene View</b> to <b>Shaded
	 Wireframe</b> to see the current wireframe. The value for <b>Hint D</b> in the <b>Default
	 Close LoD</b> is <b>16</b>. Indeed, the edge is tessellated uniformly with <b>16 segments</b>.
	 If you now get back to the inspector and change the <b>LoD</b>, you should always see that
	 the number of segments is the same you wrote in the LoD record for the <b>Hint D</b>. For
	 instance if you choose the <b>Default Normal LoD</b>, you will get <b>8 segments</b>.</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/LoDHintD_PhaseB.png"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 22</b>  Hint D + Hint D, Default Normal LoD</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Let’s now change the <b>Hints</b>. Select the <b>Default Close
	 LoD</b> in the Inspector to get back to <b>16 segments</b>. Then change <b>the Hints</b> to
	 <b>Hint M</b> to increase the tessellation. This time the edge will be tessellated with <b>52
	 segments</b>, where <b>52</b> is the value you can find in the <b>Default Close LoD</b> for
	 <b>Hint M</b>.</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">

	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">You can easily see that the change affects both the edge and the two polygons attached to the edge. The changes in tessellation are local and will not affect the rest of the model.</p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Now let’s try the case with different LoDs on the same edge. We
	 set <b>Hint D</b> on one side and <b>Hint M</b> on the other. In this way my algorithms will
	 evaluate a smoothly distributed tessellation where the number of Segments is an intermediate value between the one of <b>Hint
	 D</b> and the one of <b>Hint M</b> and the Segments are placed with a growing pace in order
	 to be closer to the side where we put the higher Hint. You can easily watch how this work by slowly changing the hints on both sides.</p>

	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">You can mark an edge (any edge) for <b>Fixed Tessellation</b>.
	 You first need to select the Brush LoD option (<img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/tessellation/brushtofreeze.png"/>).
	 Then, you must take a LoD option: </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Runtime Tessellation (default)</b>: use this to mark any edge on the model for Runtime
		 Tessellation. This is assigned by default to all edges, so if you want to have only edges with runtime tessellation you don't need to come here. Edges with runtime tessellation are marked on the Scene View with a little gray sphere in the central position.</li>
		<li><b>LoDs Options</b>: if you use the default <b>LoDs</b> these will be <b>Close, Near, Normal,
		 Far, Distant and Box</b>. Otherwise, you will find here the names of your custom <b>LoDs</b>.
		 Choose this to freeze an edge to use that specific <b>LoD</b> regardless of LoD choice on
		 this asset. Such edges will be precomputed, meaning that Curved Poly will store a pre-tessellated polyline in the <b>Curved
		 Poly Asset</b> rather than the edge itself(edge data will still be available through the Editing
		 Asset, so you can restore Runtime Tessellation with the Editor). Edges with Frozen tessellation are marked on the Scene View with a little plate showing the name of the LoD choosen for fixed tessellation.</li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 id="fixedtessellation" class="guidetitle mt-5">Tessellation Level 0</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Since version 1.2 of Curved Poly, you can assign a tessellation
	 of <b>0</b> lines to some specific hint on some specific <b>LoD</b>. Then, every time an edge
	 get assigned that hint on that <b>LoD</b>, the edge and its adjacent polygons are cut from

<p class="guideparagraph">In order to work with this feature you need to:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>This is all about to cutting parts from tessellation, so you need to choose which parts of your model need to be cut at some LoD.</li>		<li>Choose a specific hint (from <b>A</b> to <b>P</b>). It make sense to use hint A, but it
		 also make sense to use a high hint, like <b>P</b>, which you will probably never use otherwise.
		 (Hints does not, necessary, have a growing number of lines from <b>A</b> to <b>P</b>, it's
		 up to you, and that's why we are using characters and not numbers for them). You can choose more than one to achieve more complex results.</li>
		<li>Assign that hint to all the parts of your model you want to be cut on some LoDs.</li>		<li>Take the LoDs where you want to cut parts; on that LoD give the choosen Hint a Tessellation Degree equal to 0.</li>	</ul>

<h1 id="elasticityedgenormal" class="guidetitle">Elasticity and Edge Normal</h1>	

<p class="guideparagraph">In this section I discuss two important settings which are applied on edges. Both them are applied when the user is changing only one of the two sides of an edge (because one of the two vertices is selected or active and the other one is not)</p>	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Elasticity</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph"> Elasticity allows you to control how edges react when only one of their vertices is transformed. Usually drawing applications are based on the simple rule that handles should follow their vertices while moving, keeping their relative position with them. </p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Poly</b> allows you to choose among 4 different, alternative,
	 behaviours. </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/clayishedge.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Clayish</b>:
		 this means that the edge is not elastic. You will not perceive any particular elastic behaviour in Clayish mode. The edge handles will follow their vertices while moving, keeping constant their relative position. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/proportionaledge.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Proportional</b>: while moving one of the edge vertices, the relative
		 position of both handles will scale according to the new distance between the edge vertices. The surface will look like inflating or deflating while you move vertices. Note: Proportional is the default value in almost all edges of all Primitives model available with this plugin. I have made this choice because it is the elastic response with the maximum impact on the user experience. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/ellipticedge.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Elliptic</b>:
		 similar to proportional, but it takes into account the orientation of the edge on both sides. This is designed to make the elliptic edges keep elliptic during vertices transforms, but will have a coherent effect on edges not having an elliptic edge. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/elasticedge.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Elastic</b>:
		 the edge will behave like a spring, stretching when the vertices are outdistanced or flexing when you move the vertices closer one to the other. </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> Now you can try all the settings during any shaping process:
	 pressing any of the four buttons will make the settings applied on your transform (the one you are working on), so that you see how each elasticity mode will affect your last transform and you can switch to the one which looks better for you. This works both in <b>Selection
	 Operator</b> or <b>Pointings Operator</b>. Previously this was possible only by Undoing the
	 transform, changing the setting, and reworking the transform again.</p>
	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Edge Normal</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Each curved edge has as a <b>Normal</b> vector assigned to its
	 center. This normal may be used by the <a href="#polygons">Interpolation/Filling Algorithms</a> to correct the orientation of polygons across the edge, so it's very important that you understand what you can do to correct its orientation.</p>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">Usually this normal should change each time something is changing within the edge. There are three situations: </p>	
	<ul>
		<li> when using <b>Selection Operator</b> and <b>both the extremes of an edge are selected</b>:
		 in this case, the normal is rotated of the same amount applied to the parts of the edge, so it should always be correct. </li>
		<li> when using <b>Selection Operator</b> and <b>only one extreme of an edge is selected</b>,
		 or when using <b>Pointings Operator</b> for edges affected by the active element only on one
		 side: in all this cases, the normal is supposed to change. <b>Curved Poly</b> will recalculate
		 it automatically, overwriting any previous settings, with one of the available formulas. </li>
		<li> When using <b>Pointings Operator</b> with an edge active: you have many options here to
		 manually fix the edge normal for that edge. Note that any assignment done here may be overwritten at a second time by automatic procedures (so if you need to manually correct an edge normal, that should be one of your last actions on the model). </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> The way in which automatic settings for edge normals
	 are applied has been significantly improved. Now if you have made a custom editing normal (with <b>Pointings
	 Operator</b>), some of the functions (Edge Normal and Axis Normal to be precise) will try
	 to keep your settings. You can use the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/reset.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Update Selected Edges Normals</b> button to force a reset of all selected
	 normals (this is available only in <b>Selection Mode</b>). </p>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">There are three procedures available for automatic edge normal evaluation: </p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/edgenormal.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Basic
		 Edge Normal</b>: an algorithm which takes into accounts only the shape of the Edge and the
		 two editing normals on the two extremes vertices. It can be assigned <img class="backcolor-complement-0"
		 src="images/elasticities/edgenormalsettings.png"/> as the algorithm used when <b>Curved Poly</b> need to update an edge normal. It is, indeed, by default. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/axisnormal.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Axis
		 Normal</b>: an algorithm which takes into accounts the shape of the Edge, the two editing
		 normals on the two extremes vertices and also the direction of other edges nearby the extremes. Such direction is called <b>the
		 Axis</b>. <b>Axis Normal is more correct to use in situation where there are sharp angles
		 between edges</b>
		. It can be assigned <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/axisnormalsettings.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span> as the algorithm used when <b>Curved Poly</b> need to update an edge
		 normal. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/balancenormal.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Balance (or Sphere) Normal (new!)</b>: an algorithm which takes into
		 account the shape of the Edge, the two editing normals on the two extremes vertices and also the position of any opposite edge (for quads) or opposite vertex (for triangles) on adjacent polygons. <b>The
		 Editing Normal will be perfectly balanced between the two opposite positions: this is correct on spherical surfaces equally subdivided (as it is for spherical primitives)</b>
		. It can be assigned <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/balancenormalsettings.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span> (new!) as the algorithm used when <b>Curved Poly</b> need to update
		 an edge normal. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/elasticities/curvaturenormal.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Curvature Normal</b>: an algorithm which takes into accounts only
		 the shape of the Edge, forcing the Normal to follow the direction towards which the curve of the edge bends. In some situations, it gives a better results, but most of the times it doesn't. For this reason, its not good to assign it as the algorithm to be used any time <b>Curved
		 Poly</b> an update is required. So, this is only available in the <b>Pointings Operator</b> with an edge active. </li>

		 in Unity. The first is the behaviour attached to an object, the second is a recyclable geometry
		 model which can be shared on more Curved Poly Behaviour at once.</li>
		<li>A <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/gizmos/LoDsIcon.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>LoDs

<p class="guideparagraph"> Your GameObject will also have a MeshFilter and a MeshRenderer, they are automatically added together with the behaviour. The Curved Poly Behaviour assigns a new Mesh to the mesh Filter when the LoD change (either by changing the LoD asset of the LodIndex). For this reason you should never assign a Mesh manually. You should, instead, setup the MeshRenderer the way you like, first of all by selecting a good material. CurvedPoly - Shape Editor comes with a pair of materials called Normals Mat and Bisided Normals Mat, which are helpful to understand your shapes while you edit them. Both materials are base on a shader called NormalsShader which colors the surface of the mesh with a color based on normals coordinates (x component maps to red, y component maps to green, z component map to blue); such shader has 3 parameters:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Metallic</b> : same as the one Unity Standard Shader. Helpful if you need to check how
		 your shape would look with metallic effects.</li>
		<li><b>Glossiness</b> : same as the one Unity Standard Shader. Helpful if you need to check
		 how your shape would look with glossy effects.</li>
		<li><b>Bisided Normals [from 0 to 1]</b> :choose smoothly if you need or not normals to be
		 colored on both sides of each axis. For instance, when you assign 0 vertices facing the up direction will be green and the ones facing the down direction will be black; when you assign 1, vertices facing the up direction will be green and the ones facing the down direction will also be green.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> The are aware that the <b>Bisided Normals Mat</b> will
	 work only if you use the Unity Standard Pipeline. If you use one of the recent <b>Pipelines</b> (such as the Lightwave, the High Definition or the Universal one, or any custom pipeline not from Unity) it is not going to work. You can replace it with any material of course, it's only a material assigned to a Mesh Renderer. If you want to replicate the same effect of <b>Bisided
	 Normals Mat</b> or <b>Normals Mat</b> for different pipelines, look for support at <a href="http://support.mushroomslabs.com">support.mushroomslabs.com</a></p>
	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Shared Curved Poly Asset Data</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Poly Data</b> is stored in <b>Curved Poly Assets</b>.
	 You can assign the same <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> on more GameObjects, even with different
	 <b>LoD/Tessellation</b> settings.</p>
	<b>Note</b>: If two <b>GameObjects</b> share the same <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> and the same
	 <b>LoD</b> settings, they will also share the <b>same computed Mesh</b>; such meshes are kept
	 inside the Curved Poly Asset and generated on demand, both in Edit and Play mode. For this reason, you should never exceed in the number of LoDs you are using at Run-Time. 
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Objects can’t be reshaped in <b>Play</b> mode. In <b>Edit</b> mode
	 each Curved Poly Data will load an hidden editor object which responsible of all editing functions. GameObjects sharing the same Curved Poly Asset in the same Scene will access the same editor, so you can switch from one GameObject to the other to edit the content. The other GameObjects using the same asset will keep updating together. This is helpful if you plane to check how different <b>LoDs</b> will look on different Objects: create an aligned row of <b>GameObjects</b> with the same <b>Curved
	 Poly Asset</b>, the same <b>LoDs</b> Asset and assign each one a different <b>LoD</b>; when
	 you change something in the first <b>GameObject</b> with the <b>Pointings</b> or the <b>Selection
	 Operators</b> you should see the changes applied on all the other GameObjects. If something
	 goes wrong, try to click/select first each of the <b>GameObjects</b>: opening the inspector
	 will force the editor to load their settings and will realign their data.</p>

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Saving and Loading Assets</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">The first time you create a <b>Curved Poly</b> Behaviour, a new
	 <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> is generated in the editor, but its data is not saved in the project.
	 So, you can shape your model, but if you close the editor or change scene you will lose everything. There are a few actions you can take to save/load your model in/from a valid <b>Curved
	 Poly Asset</b>.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Import</b> : pressing the import button will load the list of all available Curved Poly
		 Asset in your project. After choosing one, the content of your current Curved Poly Asset will be overwritten with the content of the selected one. This action will not affect the asset your are copying from in any way.</li>
		<li><b>Save</b> : pressing the Save button saves the content of your Asset in its assigned
		 file. If you didn’t previously assign a file, you will be asked to generate one first. If you press ok, the editor will generate a new Curved Poly Asset at the default path Assets/CurvedPoly/User, with a default name, but you can move it in the Project Panel where you want and rename it the way you like. You don’t need to save a Curved Poly Asset when you work on other GameObjects in the scene, because the editor will keep your data until it’s destroyed by either closing the scene or closing Unity.</li>
		<li><b>Ctrl+S (File > Save Scene)</b> : when you save the scene, your edited Curved Poly Assets
		 will be automatically saved. Only if you have selected a GameObject with a Curved Poly Asset and its content has not been assigned a real asset file, you will prompted to accept to generate a new one.</li>
		<li><b>Save New</b> :pressing the Save New button generates a new Curved Poly Asset, copying
		 in it the data of the one you are working on. The Asset will be a perfect copy and will have its own new editor instance.</li>
		<li><b>Change the Curved Poly Asset with the inspector</b>: when you change the Asset in the
		 inspector, the Editor will also perform a Save action on the previous one before switching them.</li>
		<li><b>Create a Curved Poly Asset in the Project Panel first</b>: you can also create a new
		 Curved Poly Asset in the Project Panel for instance in the Assets menu with <b>Create > CurvedPoly
		 > CurvedPolyAsset</b>. Then you can assign it to your GameObject Curved Poly Behaviour. After
		 this, you will have an empty shape and you will need to perform an Import to have something to work on.</li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Do Import, Don't Duplicate</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">There are many ways to create a Duplicate of a <b>Curved Poly Asset</b>.
	 One option is to load the asset on a <b>new Curved Poly</b>, then use the <b>Save New</b> option. Or you can create a new Curved Poly, <b>Import</b> the one you want to duplicate and save it with <b>Save</b>.
	 You could also duplicate it in the inspector, but in that case <b>Curved Poly</b> will make
	 a slightly different work: the duplicate may be broken into more parts when the original model has texture coordinates.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">There is a reason. As explained in the next section, <b>Curved
	 Poly</b> uses two data formats, one for real time operations and one for editing. The real
	 time format is simplified compared to the editing one. When you use Unity <b>Duplication</b> in project explorer, only the real time format will be duplicated (while, for instance, <b>Import</b> will create a copy of both of them). Then, if you try to edit the <b>Curved
	 Poly Asset</b>, the edit format will be generated from scratch and it will miss important
	 informations from the original model.</p>
	

<h4 id="editingdata" class="guidetitle mt-5">Editing Data</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">There is a <b>second asset</b> saved together with the Curved Poly
	 Asset when you press <b>Save</b>.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> the <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> stores all the informations required to regenerate tessellated
		 meshes in Play Mode (and, generally, at execution time). Data has a compressed format and it's hidden in the inspector.</li>
		<li> the <b>Curved Poly Editor Asset</b> ( the script name is <b>MLab.CurvedPoly.eHPN.Data.EditablePolygonsNetData</b> ) contains the same data (in an uncompressed format) and all the additional informations which are only necessary in edit mode.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">A few things about the Curved Poly Editor Asset:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li> All the <b>Curved Poly Editor Assets</b> are saved at path <b>Assets/CurvedPoly/User/Editor</b> by default.</li>
		<li> I keep a reference to the GUID of the <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> in the the <b>Curved Poly
		 Editor Asset</b>, so you can move the <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> where you want and I will be
		 able to find its editing counterpart. Also: I will keep the <b>Curved Poly Editor Asset</b> renamed with a name which is calculated on the location of the Asset. For instance, if you move the asset at path <b>Assets/Examples/CP/MyCurvedPolyAsset</b> the other asset name will be <b>Assets/CurvedPoly/User/Editor/Examples_CP_MyCurvedPolyAsset</b> (Basically I take the path and replace the character ‘/’ with the character ‘_’). Names are aligned when you perform a Save action on the asset, so you may experience some misalignment before pressing the Save button again on the Inspector or if you don't save the asset at all.</li>
		<li> If you move the <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> to another project alone, a new <b>Curved Poly
		 Editor Asset</b> will be generated in the new project, and your custom editing data will be
		 lost. You can manually move both the assets in the new project to find back your settings.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">There is a second location where <b>Curved Poly</b> looks for the
	 <b>Curved Poly Editor Asset</b>. Such location is a folder named <b>Editor</b> inside the
	 folder the <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> resides. So for instance, if you have your <b>Curved Poly
	 Asset</b> at path <b>Assets/Examples/CP/MyCurvedPolyAsset</b>, the <b>Curved Poly Editor Asset</b> will be searched at path <b>Assets/Examples/CP/Editor</b> before checking the default <b>Assets/CurvedPoly/User/Editor</b> folder. So you can move the editing assets from the default location to a subfolder of your assets folder, which is useful when you need to move files from your project to another.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Another important editor feature of <b>Curved Poly Editor Asset</b>s
	 is locking, which is used for instance by our <b>Curved Poly Primitives</b>. You can lock
	 a <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> (making it a custom primitive) by renaming its <b>Curved Poly Editor
	 Asset</b>, adding the special string <b>model0</b> at the end of the name. In this way, any
	 attempt to save the Curved Poly Asset will be blocked with a warning message.</p>

	<p class="guideparagraph">For instance, all the Primitives of Curved Poly - Shape Editor
	 (find them at <b>Assets/CurvedPoly/Assets/Primitives</b> ) have theirs editing assets (find
	 them at <b>Assets/CurvedPoly/Assets/Primitives/Editor</b>) renamed with the special <b>model0</b> string.</p>
	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Settings</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">You can control general settings from the <b>Settings</b> panel.
	 </p>

		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 29</b>  Settings Panel.</p>
	</div>

	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Scene View Menus</b>: you can hide (or show) Menus from Scene View. This settings is
		 an Editor Settings, meaning that it should persist through different models and different projects.</li>
		<li><b>Scene View Dynamic Menu</b>: you can selectively hide (or show) the Dynamic Menus from
		 Scene View. When this is disabled, but <b>Scene View Menus</b> is enabled, you will see only
		 the main menu, with Operators Buttons, but you will miss all the controls in the bottom of the scene view.</li>
		<li><b>Scene View Detailed Inspectors (has no effect if you have Shape Editor)</b>: you can
		 selectively hide (or show) the Details Inspectors: the Geometry Inspector and the Selection Inspector which you can find in many Curved Poly Maker Operators. </li>
		<li><b>Open Editor Window</b>: open an Editor Window which is alternative to Scene View Menus.
		 Remember that Operators choice is per view: when more Scene Views are open, the state of the Window will change to show the Operator available on your last active Scene View (this meaning that in some circumstances, it make sense to reactivate the editor menus to check which operator is active on each scene view, or to keep control other more operators at once). You can access this window also by searching it in the Editor Menu at <b>Windows>Curved
		 Poly>Editor Window</b></li>
		<li><b>Open LoDs preview</b>: open an Editor Window which shows a preview of all LoDs available
		 for this model, evaluated on the actual <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> and <b>LoDs Asset</b>. You
		 can access this window also by searching it in the Editor Menu at <b>Windows>Curved Poly>Previews
		 Window</b>.</li>
		<li><b>Use High Def./Lightwave RP Mats.</b>: this is very important settings which controls
		 the way Curved Poly choose the technical materials it uses to work. If you are using the Standard Unity Pipeline, you should uncheck this; if you use one of the most recent pipelines, you should check this. This settings is an Editor Settings, meaning that it should persist through different models and different projects. </li>
		<li><b>Reset the Default Material</b>: re-assign the Default Material ( <b>Bisided Normals
		 Mat</b> or <b>Bisided Normals Mat PBR </b>) on this Curved Poly (use this if you generated
		 the Game Object before assigning Use High Def./Lightwave RP Mats. and the material looks pink) </li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Model</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">The Model section of the inspector controls many features which are related to the model itself. </p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Mesh Mode</b>: controls which mesh data are generated both at runtime and in edit mode.</li>
		<li><b>Colliders</b>: controls the way in which colliders are updated when the mesh changes.
		 </li>
		<li><b>Mesh References</b>: allows you to generate Mesh Assets on your project; Curved Poly
		 will use these Mesh assets at runtime, and you can refer to such assets if you want to access the meshes generated with Curved Poly with other tools. This also works as an alternative way to export mesh data from a curved poly since generated Mesh assets can be used as any other mesh in Unity.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Mesh Mode</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph"> Mesh Mode controls which mesh data are generated every time meshes a re-computed. </p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Default</b>: generates vertices,normals and uv.</li>
		<li><b>No Uv</b>: generates vertices,normals, but no uv. </li>
		<li><b>Default + Tangents </b>: generates vertices, normals, uv and tangents.</li>
		<li><b>Default + Tangents + Auto UV2 </b>: generates vertices, normals, uv and tangents, then
		 copy uv into uv2.</li>
	</ul>
	Please. We are aware we should have much more options here. If you feel you may need some specific
	 Mesh Mode, contact us at <a href="http://support.mushroomslabs.com/">support.mushroomslabs.com</a> with your opinion. We will consider your needs in future releases.
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Colliders</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">If your game object has also a Collider, Curved Poly can recompute and assign Collider, both at runtime and in edit mode. There are three options:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Manual</b>: Curved Poly does not change collider data.</li>
		<li><b>Auto: Sphere, Box or Capsule Collider</b>: recomputed Sphere, Box or Capsule Collider,
		 with updated mesh data if any oh these is attached to the game object.</li>
		<li><b>Auto: Mesh Collider by LoD </b>: assign a Mesh Collider with the Mesh generated from
		 one of the Level of Details in the LoDs asset of your choice.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Mesh References</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Curved Poly</b> can generate Mesh Assets and use them to store
	 data generated from tessellation. When this assets are generated, you can exploit such meshes with every other Unity tool. Curved Poly may keep updating that meshes even at runtime, each time it is required. A full set of meshes is generated for each asset, one for each Level of Detail available in the LoDs file. Such meshes are kept together in an asset name MeshRefAsset.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Generate Mesh Ref from LoD</b>: generate a new Mesh Ref Asset with more meshes inside,
		 one for each Level of Detail, and assign it to the Curved Poly object you are inspecting.</li>
		<li><b>Update all meshes</b>: If anything is changed in the model, use this to recompute all
		 data in the Mesh Ref Asset.</li>
		<li><b>Remove Mesh Ref</b>: remove the reference, but doesn't destroy the MeshRefAsset with
		 its meshes. Once a reference has been removed, Curved Poly will generate fresh-new meshes at runtime which you cannot access from Unity Editor.</li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Asset</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Here you can control Compression Modes for your asset, in the same
	 way compression modes can be controlled from Curved Poly Asset Inspector. Please, refer to the <a
	 href="assetsandlibraries">Chapter on Curved Poly Assets and Libraries</a> for more details</p>
	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Curved Poly Statistics</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">This panel is part of the Inspector and it shows the count of vertices, curves and polygons your Curved Poly Asset is made of.</p>	

<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">(new!) Now the panel will show separated statistics for the Edit Model and the Runtime Model. It also shows the number of geometries</p>	

<h4 id="handles" class="guidetitle mt-5">Mesh Statistics</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">This panel is part of the Inspector and it shows the count of vertices and faces (Triangles) of the last Mesh your Curved Poly Behaviour put in the MeshFilter. This is useful because Mesh Statistics change when you change LoD, and you may be interested to know how much vertices and triangles you are using at RunTime. You also have two additional buttons here, you need to use carefully:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Remove Curved Poly</b>: this action will remove the Curved Poly Behaviour from the GameObject,
		 keeping the Mesh in the MeshFilter. This is helpful if you want to use <b>Curved Poly - Shape
		 Editor</b> as a <b>Mesh Generator</b>, but you don’t care to use it at <b>Execution/Play Time</b>.</li>
		<li><b>Recalculate Normals</b>: this action uses Unity RecalculateNormals method to update
		 the Mesh Normals. Curved Poly normals are usually good and you should not perceive any significant difference after normal recalculation. That said, the Curved Poly normals evaluator is still not perfect and there are a few situations in which you may feel there’s something wrong. So, here is your alternative. That said, Curved Poly Editor will rewrite normals again the first time you change something. For this reason, there are only two ways to exploit Recalculate Normals: 
		<ul>
			<li><b>As a Check</b>, to verify if something is going wrong. Most of the times you will have
			 bad normals in the model because there’s something wrong with the model handles or with the elasticity settings. If, after applying Remove Curved Poly, the bad normals are still there, than you should try to work on your model with the Pointings Operator and pointing your handles one by one. Usually you can get better results by working on the Handles Length or Weight.</li>
			<li><b>Before using Remove Curved Poly</b>, if you are planning to remove the Curved Poly Behaviour
			 and you think that RecalculateNormals can give you a better result, go for it.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">History</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Curved Poly - Shape Editor has its own History storing a reference to any change you make on the model. When you use Unity Undo or Redo actions on a Curved Poly Behaviour, the Editor will keep such History system aligned with Unity one.</p>	

<p class="guideparagraph">At the same time, a maximum of ten actions you performed on the model will be listed in the Inspector. When you Undo, undone actions will have their font-color changed from black to gray, in order to help you understand at which step you are in the history. In this version of Curved Poly - Shape Editor only the last ten actions stored in the history will be shown, so if you Undo more times you will not be able to see undone actions in the Inspector.</p>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Moreover: since the Editor is shared between Curved Poly Behaviours having the same Curved Poly Asset, also the History is shared and you will be able to see the actions you took also while Inspecting other GameObjects.</p>	

<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">(new!) Now the panel will show a control to choose the maximum number of elements stored in curved poly history. Lower the number down if you think that curved poly is using too much of the editor memory.</p>	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">LoDs</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">You can edit the LoDs asset also in the Curved Poly Inspector. This is helpful when you are learning Curved Poly Editing for the first time. However, you should use this carefully because changing a LoDs asset within the Curved Poly Inspector will affect any other Curved Poly Behaviour using that LoDs asset, even the ones not being in the actually selected scene.</p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Update</b> : this is an additional button, not present in the
	 LoDs inspector, which allows you to update manually your Curved Poly Mesh after you have finished changing a LoDs tessellation data.</p>

<p class="guideparagraph">The Curved Poly Asset Inspector allows you to inspect a curved poly asset before adding it to the scene or importing it into an already generating Curved Poly Game Object. A preview of the asset will show the shape of the model, all the edges and in the case the model is made of more parts (submeshes) you will also see that parts with different colors.</p>	

<p class="guideparagraph">The inspector also gives a few functionalites to the asset:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Add To Scene</b>: automatically add a new Curved Poly with this <b>Curved Poly Asset</b> assigned. You may want to press <b>Save
		 New</b> in the <b>Curved Poly</b> soon afterwards if the plan is to edit a different version
		 of your model.</li>
		<li><b>Copy into Library</b>: create a copy of the asset and save it into a selected Curved
		 Poly Assets Library. (libraries are explained in the next section).</li>
		<li><b>Fix Default Editor Assets</b>: automatically generate an <b>Editor</b> folder (if missing)
		 in the same folder of the asset and moves inside it the editing data of this assets (see <a
		 href="curvedpolyinspector">Curved Poly Inspector</a> for more informations about Editing Data
		 Assets).</li>
		<li><b>Delete</b>: delete the assets and its editing data (if you delete the asset in the standard
		 way, its editing counterpart will still be in the project, so this helps keeping the things clean).</li>
		<li><b>Clean All unused Editor Assets</b>: check all the project for editor assets which has
		 lost its runtime asset counterpart (this happens when you remove in the Project Panel instead of pressing <b>Delete</b>)
		 and remove them from the project.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">All the buttons in this inspector work also for multiple selections of Curved Poly Assets. This was done with the objective to shorten the time required to deal with assets.</p>	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b>At the moment it's strongly recommended
	 to <b>(A)</b> manually use <b>Fix Default Editor Assets every time you manually move a Curved
	 Poly Asset</b> from the default <b>Curved Poly/User</b> folder to another folder. <b>Alternatively:
	 (B)</b> you can move manually the editor asset as well, or <b>(C)</b> you can press <b>Save</b> on the inspector on any <b>Curved
	 Poly</b> using the asset: this will change the Editor Asset name with a name which is specific
	 for the new asset location. <b>If you don't do any of these three actions</b>, the Editor
	 Asset will be kept in the default <b>Curved Poly/User/Editor</b> with a default name. If this
	 is the case, the Editor Asset will be reused the next time you save a new Curved Poly Asset, making the previous asset loose its connection to the Editor Asset. </p>
	<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Curved Poly Asset : Compression Modes (New in version 1.2)</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Compression Modes have been introduced in version 1.2.</b>.
	 Here you can control the way data is compressed in one (or more) <b>Curved Poly Asset</b>.
	 Compressed data affects Curved Poly you are using at runtime, so you will not perceive any compression in edit mode, especially if you use Curved Poly as a mesh generation tool without exploiting its runtime features. To change settings for more Curved Poly Assets, select them all together in Unity Project Panel.</p>

<p class="guideparagraph">Curved Poly simplifies numbers used at runtime in order to reduce the space they take on files, and it does do so by cutting useless digits. So for example, you may have a coordinate of 1.8472395, but there is no practical reason to store so much digits for a number, and you may prefer to store something like 1.8472 instead. Compression Settings allow you to control how much digits are cut on each value.</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Asset Byte Size</b>: shows you the total number of bytes taken to store a Curved Poly
		 Asset. This value is calculated on raw asset data, the total amount of data is slightly different since it takes into account the overhead introduced with Unity Serialization. This overhead is reduced if your asset is stored as part of a library with many models rather than one single asset.</li>
		<li><b>Presets</b>: by default, a model is set with the <b>Normal</b> preset compresssion mode,
		 You can change this to <b>High</b> or <b>Low</b> if you need a higher/lower precision. Or
		 you can change the parameters the way you wish to get into <b>Custom</b> preset.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">You can control vertex precision. Options are:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>MILLI (0.001) (Default)</b>: Vertices are stored with a precision of 0.001 units. Any
		 number littler than 0.001 is automatically cut and ignored. So, for instance, if 1 unit is 1 meter for you, here you have a precision of 1 mm on every coordinate, which is fair enough if you are modeling real objects of average dimension. </li>
		<li><b>DECIMILLI (0.001) (Default)</b>: same, but precision is 0.0001 units. This is better
		 when you are modeling very small objects.</li>
		<li><b>CENTI (0.01) (Default)</b>: same, but precision is 0.01 units. </li>
		<li><b>DECI (0.1) (Default)</b>: same, but precision is 0.1 units.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">You can control precision for normals vectors. Al normals vectors are unity vector, so coordinates are always in the range [-1,1]. Options are:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Medium (Default)</b>: vector coordinates are store with a precision of 1/240 (almost
		 0.00417)</li>
		<li><b>Low </b>: vector coordinates are store with a precision of 1/60 (almost 0.0167)</li>
		<li><b>High </b>: vector coordinates are store with a precision of 1/960 (almost 0.0001042)</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">You can control precision for uv, here you have much more alternatives. Options are:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>1 on 10000 (Default)</b>: Like for vertices, precision is 0.0001, every number littler
		 than 0.0001 is cut.</li>
		<li><b>1 on 10</b>: same with precision 0.1 </li>
		<li><b>1 on 100</b>: same with precision 0.01 </li>
		<li><b>1 on 1000</b>: same with precision 0.001 </li>
		<li><b>1 on 128 </b>: 1 pixel precision on textures on width and height equals to 128.</li>

	 a set of <b>28 Premade Curved Poly</b> model which should be your starting point every time
	 you need to shape a new Model. <b>Curved Poly - Shape Editor</b> does not allow you to add

	<ul>
		<li><b>Sphere</b> : a very simple closed shape with eight curved triangles making a sphere.
		 The best way to start learning curved poly and at the same time a very flexible instrument to model simple shapes. </li>
		<li><b>Circle</b> : opened surface made of 4 curved triangles making a circle. </li>
		<li><b>Cylinders</b> : there are 3 cylinders, with an increasing number of polygons. Each cylinder
		 is made of 4 curved triangles on the top and on the bottom, and, respectively, 4, 8 and 12 curved quads on the sides. There are also the opened versions called CylinderBorder without caps. </li>
		<li><b>Donuts</b> : there are 3 donuts, with an increasing number of polygons. Donuts are made
		 of 16, 24 and 32 curved quads. </li>
		<li><b>ChamferBoxes</b> : there are 4 chamfer box, each one made with 6 grids of curved quads,
		 connected by other polygons to form a cube with rounded borders. In each corner is made with a smooth curved triangle. </li>
		<li><b>Plates</b> : similar to <b>ChamferBoxes</b>, but they only use 2 grids of quads and
		 they extend on x and z directions. You can also find the opened versions missing the grids and called <b>PlateBorders</b>.

	<p class="guideparagraph"> In the <b>Demo</b> folder <b>(Assets/CurvedPoly/Demo)</b> you
	 will find two important Demo Scene called <b>PrimitivesDisplayPartA</b> and <b>PrimitivesDisplayPartB</b>.
	 The two demos show all the primitives at once (Sphere, Circle, Cylinders and Donuts in the first; Boxes, Plates and Quads in the second).

<h1 id="hidingoperator" class="guidetitle">Hide Operator</h1>	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">This Operator requires <b>Curved Poly - Maker</b></p>


	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/mkoperators/hideoperatorview.png"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 34</b> Hide Operator</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">With the <b>Hide Operator</b> you can hide elements you don't want
	 to see. Many Operators will skip automatically hidden elements so that you don't accidentally modify them. Hiding parts of a model you are not working on is very important if you need to fix and work on details of complex objects. </p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><b>Hide Operator</b> works the same as <b>Selection Operator</b> when it comes to choose which parts need to be hidden. You can drag freely the mouse on the screen to add elements to your selection:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> When the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/circleselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Circular Selector</b>: is active, a circle will be drawn and you will
		 be able to hide elements by dragging it on the Scene View. You can also change the size of the circle with the buttons <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> on the keyboard. </li>
		<li> When the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/rectangleselection.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Rectangular Selector</b>: is active, you can drag on the Scene View
		 a rectangle and everything touched by the rectangle will be hidden. </li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">For both the two selector, you will be able to choose between this two options:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/inclusiveselection.png"/><b>Part</b>:
		 elements will be hidden when the circle/rectangle cover even a little part of them. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/operators/exclusiveselection.png"/><b>Full</b>:
		 elements will be hidden only when the circle/rectangle cover them entirely. The algorithm here takes into account only the visible part of edges and polygons, so it’s more correct to say that the element is selected when its visible part is covered by the tool. </li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>Very Important!!</b>: in this operator the Circular
	 and Rectangular Selectors do not extend from polygons to edges and from edges to vertices (unlike what happens with <b>Selection
	 Operator</b>). So, for instance, you can hide a polygon without its vertices being hidden
	 and viceversa.</p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Common Hiding Actions</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">There are a few hiding actions available here, and also available in other Operators:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/hiding/hideSelected.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Hide
		 Selected</b>: Hide any selected element. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/hiding/hideUnSelected.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Hide
		 Unselected</b>: Hide everything which has not been selected (opposite of Hide Selected). </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/hiding/showAll.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Show
		 All</b>: shows all hidden elements. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/hiding/hideInvisible.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Hide
		 Invisible</b>: hide elements which are not directly visible in the Scene View, the ones watching
		 on the opposite side of the screen. </li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">Furthermore, in this operator you have the following action available :</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/edit/cancelSelection.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Cancel
		 Hidden</b>: Remove from the model everything which has been hidden. If you have hidden vertices
		 any edge or polygon attached to the vertex will be removed as well, even if they are not hidden. </li>

	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">All these operations will need some selection. Once any operation has been activated, you will enter into an operation state which will block many other actions. In order to get out of the operation and select a new one you can:</p>

	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">Circleify forces a set of vertices to lay on a circle and than gives you control on the circle parameters. This is very useful if you have a closed path of edges and you want to make it a perfect circle. It is also useful if you have a circle in you model or primitive and you want to shape it without breaking its circular shape. Here the parameters you can change:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Position</b>: the Position of the center of the circle</li>
		<li><b>Rotation</b>: absolute Rotation with respect to a Default circle laying on the XZ plane.
		 This should help you correct the circle orientation when needed.</li>
		<li><b>Vertical(%)</b>: scaling factor applied on the handles of the vertices of the circle.
		 This scaling is applied only on the Vertical direction, that is the direction being at 90 degrees (orthogonal) to the circle plane.</li>
		<li><b>rotation</b>: lateral inclination of the handles of each vertex. This is applied with
		 rotational symmetry (so if two vertices are in opposite direction, this rotation will happen towards opposite directions.)</li>
		<li><b>r (radius)</b>: radius of the circle.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph"> The rotation, Vertical and r can be controlled with magenta arrows in the scene view. Position and rotation can instead be controlled with Unity transform tools. All the parameters can be changed in the menu.</p>

<p class="guideparagraph">Cylindric Transform is similar to Circleify, but it does not force vertices to take some specific shape. It rather generates a cylindric shaped volumes around selected vertices, and then makes you transform the cylindric volume to reshape all that vertices at once. This is a very useful instrument if you want to create rotational surfaces from cylindric primitives for instance. Here the parameters you can change:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Position</b>: the Position of the center of the cylindric volume.</li>
		<li><b>Normal</b>: The vertical direction of the cylindric volume, which is by default (0,1,0)
		 since this is coherent with the setup of many primitives you can generate with <a href="#createoperator">Create
		 Operator</a>. This parameter can only be changed in the menu with a manual insertion of values.
		 </li>
		<li><b>radius</b>: radius of the cylinder.</li>
		<li><b>hScale(%)</b>: vertical scale of the cylinder, in the direction of the normal.</li>
		<li><b>rotation</b>: lateral inclination. This is applied with rotational symmetry, and allows
		 you to transform the cylindric volume into a Conic one.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph"> The rotation, hScale and rotation can be controlled with magenta arrows in the scene view. The Position can instead be controlled with Unity transform tools. All the parameters can be changed in the menu.</p>

	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">Curved Selection Transform allows you to transform groups of points at once in a way that makes transforms on edges between the groups blend smoothly. Before you enter the transform you need to plan carefully which vertices you want to select:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Selected vertices will become lead vertices</b>: lead vertices controls the position
		 of other vertices.</li>
		<li><b>Unselected vertices will become passive vertices</b>: each passive vertex is assigned
		 to one of the lead vertices, depending upon their distances. (There is no other options about this, but we may have more options in the future)</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph"> Once active,the operation works in a way which is similar to the pointings operator, but you will be allowed to point only lead vertices. Once you point a lead vertex, all its assigned passive vertices will be selected and also the edges connecting vertices in the group will be selected. The entire group will follow any transform you apply to the lead vertex.</p>	

<p class="guideparagraph"> On each lead vertex you can also find 6 transform handles which will allow you to scale or screw the group on its relative x, y or z axis. The handles are 6 because there are separated scaling factor for down and up, left and right, forward and backward.</p>	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> This transform always affect all vertices of your model
	 with the exception of the ones which have been hidden, so you may want to hide parts of the model you don't want to be affected by these transforms. That said, it is recommended to use this transform on fresh Curved Polys with only one shape inside: after shaping it and saving the shape, you can always insert it into a more complex Curved Poly with the <b>Insert</b> button you can find in <a

<p class="guideparagraph">Proportional Transform allows you to transform groups of vertices and make other unselected vertices follow the transform in a smooth, weighted way. Before you enter the transform you need to plan carefully which vertices you want to select:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Selected vertices will become full transform vertices</b>: full transform vertices will
		 follow the transform with a 100% weight. Usually it may make sense to activate the tool with only one selected vertex.</li>
		<li><b>Vertices within a specific distance from the selection will become passive vertices</b>:
		 each passive vertex is assigned a weight which depends on the distance. </li>
		<li><b>Vertices at a greater distance will be unaffected</b></li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph"> Once active, it will be possible to transform the selection using Unity Transform Tools, like it happens in the Selection Operator. Full transform vertices will follow the transform, while passive vertices will change their position more slowly, at a pace which depends upon their weight. During the transform every vertex will be drawn has a sphere with a color which blends between gray and magenta: gray means that the vertex has a 0% weight assigned and magenta means that the vertex as a 100% weight assigned. A Distance function is applied to determine such weights with this parameters: </p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Dist (Distance Function)</b>: the distance at which the weights become 0%.</li>

	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">With Sparkling Transform you can replicate changes you make on a vertex handles to other vertices. You need to select the vertices you want to work on, than the transform will try to match the handles across that vertices in order to apply symmetric changes. There are two relevant cases in which this transform does a good work:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>You select a set of vertices having all the same editing normal and the same amount of handles (this is common if you are working on a Curved Poly primitive).</li>		<li>You select a set of vertices on a circle. Any change will (hopefully) be applied in a way which is symmetric to the center of the circle.</li>	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">The transform will work in any case, but it may fail matching handles on different vertices if it doesn't find a good mapping of the handles.</p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> Once active, you can point on a vertex and then you can point
	 on one of its handle to change its length, roll or pitch, the same way you can do in Pointings Operator, but here any change is replicated to all mapped handles on the other vertices, making all selected vertices change in shape at once in the most symmetric way possible (again: this depends on how good is your starting selection so you should have a try and maybe <b>Close</b> the operator to roll it back and make a different selection of vertices) </p>

	 In order to do so, you need first to have an unwrapped model, either a premade curved poly you have imported or a model you have unwrapped with the <a

	<p class="guideparagraph">When you need to create a uv mapping for a model you usually need
	 to open it by cutting it somewhere. (That is true for any closed surface, but may also apply to open ones). So: what is a continuous, closed, set of polygons in 3d space, may become a set of separated parts in uv space. With Curved Poly these parts are called <b>Unwrap
	 Groups</b>. For example: a sphere may be made of 8 polygons for a total of 12 edges. But after
	 unwrapping, in UV space you may find it split into two halves, each one of 4 polygons, with a total of 16 edges. The number of edges increase because in uv space the edges where you cut the model are duplicated. </p>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">The UV Operator greatly rely on the Unwrap Groups. Unwrap Groups can be moved and shaped inside uv space for an easy control other uv coordinates. </p>

	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">Curved Poly uses a uv panel which shows unwrapped uv coordinates and which is integrated in the Scene View (rather than being drawn on a separated window). Once you enter the UV Operator the panel will be placed somewhere on the left or on the right of your model, perfectly aligned with your camera. You can then move it, rotate it or scale the way you want using the Unity Transform Tools: in order to do so you may need to point (click) the little orange pivot over the top of the panel, but the pivot is already pointed by default when you first activate the operator (so, you will see directly the transform tools, and the little pivot will be visible only after you point something else)</p>	

<p class="guideparagraph">The panel draws all the edges of the model using its uv coordinates. It also draws different other things depending on the selected mode, which can be:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/uvs/unwrapgroup.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><a

	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">The Panel has a few parameters which can be used to customize your experience:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Image</b>: you can assign a texture to the panel background </li>
		<li><b>Color</b>: a background color which is applied to the image if you have one selected.
		 </li>
		<li><b>background (UV Panel Settings)</b>: controls the dimension of the background rendered
		 inside the panel. </li>
		<li><b>padding (UV Panel Settings)</b>: the panel has a gray margin; this parameter controls
		 the size of the padding around the background. Note: it's not a padding amount, its the final size of the most external quad in the panel. The editor will keep it higher than <b>background</b>,
		 whatever you do (by, at least, an amount of 0.1). </li>
		<li><b>tiling (UV Panel Settings)</b>: a value applied to scale the texture within the background

		<li>See the list of <b>Unwrap Groups</b>. Unwrap Groups haven't a name, they are simply numbered.
		 You can use the checkbox near the label <b>Group #-#</b> to control the visibility of the

<h1 id="cpanatomy" class="guidetitle">Anatomy of a Curved Poly Model</h1>	

<p class="guideparagraph">A Curved Poly is made of many elements, in a way which is similar to polygonal meshes, but with much more features which need to be understood if you want to take control of any aspect of making Curved Polys. There are a total of 6 element types in a Curved Poly:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Vertices</b>: points.</li>
		<li><b>Handles</b>: handles are used to control the shape of curved edges.</li>
		<li><b>Edges</b>: edges connect vertices.</li>
		<li><b>Polygons</b>: a polygon is a piece of surface built inside a set of edges.</li>
		<li><b>Geometries</b>: a geometry is a set of polygons. A Curved Poly model may have one ore
		 more geometry, each one with one or more polygons. You will split the model into more geometries so that you can assign a different material to each one.</li>
		<li><b>Unwrap Groups</b>: a subset of a geometry, used to deal with uvs. A Geometry can have
		 one or more unwrap groups, each one having one or more polygons. Polygons belonging to the same Geometry, but to different unwrap groups, may be contiguous in the 3D space, but they will be detached in uv space. </li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">Each one of these elements has its own parameters and features. Furthermore, during edit a few additional support elements are evaluated. Such elements are:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Corners</b>: little structure computed around vertices which are used during polygons
		 generation.</li>
		<li><b>(Edge) Bindings</b>: complex chain of vertices and edges connecting two corners, they
		 are used during polygons generation. Such bindings will satisfy important constraints required to make interpolation schemas work well.</li>
		<li><b>(Polygon) Matches</b>: a closed set of Edge Bindings is always a good candidate to be
		 used to generate a polygon.</li>
		<li><b>Unwrap Functions</b>: functions used to cut a geometry into unwrap groups and to assign
		 uv coordinates to all the vertices (and handles) at once.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">In this section we will discuss some more properties about the
	 6 elements types. Further informations about Corners, Bindings and Matches will instead be given in the chapter <a
	 href="#inspectingfixing">About Fixing and Inspecting</a>. Unwrap Function will be explained
	 in the chapter <a href="#unwrapsoperator">About the Unwraps Operator</a></p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Vertices Smoothness</h4>

	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/cpanatomy/smoothandsharpvertices.jpg"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 54</b> A Smooth Vertex (on the Left) and 2 Sharp Vertices (on the Right)</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> A Vertex may be <b>Smooth</b> or <b>Sharp</b>. When a vertex is
	 smooth, any handle (of any edge) attached to it will be forced to stay at 90 degrees from the vertex editing normal, making all the handles lay on the same plane. Such condition is not applied for sharp vertices. In the scene view, sharp vertices are rendered as empty squares, while smooth vertices are rendered as little cubes. </p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> A Vertex Smoothness is assigned automatically by certain operators
	 and can always be changed in the <a href="#editoperator">Edit Operator</a>. </p>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>Smoothness</b> affects also the way curved polys are
	 get ready for runtime: indeed, each sharp vertex is cloned an amount of times equal to the number of polygons using that vertex, each clone having a different normal evaluated on its polygon. You can check how the number of runtime vertices changes in the inspector inside the panel called <b>Curved
	 Poly Statistics</b>. </p>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> The <b>Editing Normal</b> may look useless for a sharp
	 vertex (since the normal is taken from the polygons), but that's not true. On a sharp vertex the editing normal play an important role in the construction of a vertex corners, and therefore it's used as a parameter to control polygon generation. This will be discussed in the section <a
	 href="#inspectingfixing">About Fixing and Inspecting</a>. </p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Edges Smoothness</h4>

		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 55</b> Sharp Edges</p>
	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph"> Edges may also be sharp or smooth and like vertices sharp edges will be duplicated with a separated normals assignments when a curved poly is prepared for runtime uses. Unlike vertices, you can't directly decide if an edge is smooth: an edge is automatically smooth when it's vertices are. An edge is automatically sharp if at least one of its edges is sharp. </p>	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> Unlike vertices, the <b>Editing Normal</b> of a sharp
	 edges is complete ignored. </p>
	

<h4 id="handlesalignments" class="guidetitle mt-5">Handles Alignments</h4>

	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">Two handles attached to the same vertex may be aligned. An alignment force the two handles to stay on the same straight line, usually facing opposite directions, so when you edit the first, the second may change as well.</p>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Handles alignments are visible only in the <a href="#editoperator">Edit
	 Operator</a> and they are rendered as little lines near to the main vertex. Alignments are
	 generated automatically in the <a href="#createoperator">Create Operator</a>. The <a href="#editoperator">Edit
	 Operator</a> features many buttons to remove or generate alignments.</p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Linear Edges</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Edges may be linear. A linear edge has no handles. Linear edges
	 are generated by some tools in <b>Create Operator</b> or <b>Edit Operator</b> and can always
	 be changed into smooth objects at a second time (in <b>Edit Operator</b>).</p>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> Linear edges ignore tessellation hints. A linear edge
	 is always a single segment, both in edit mode, in runtime mode and in any computed mesh. You can generate a <b>Cube</b> in <b>Create
	 Operator</b> to see this at work. </p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Vertices and Edges Multiplicity</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Polygons may be grouped into different Unwrap Groups. Because of this, a vertex belonging to more polygons may also belong to more Unwrap Groups. A vertex belonging to more unwraps groups will have one single position in 3D space, but it will have different uv coordinates, one for each unwrap Groups. For this reason, once the model is made ready for runtime, the vertex will be clone more times. A Vertex Multiplicity will be:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>One</b>: for smooth vertices belonging only to one unwrap group</li>
		<li><b>Equal to the Number of its Unwrap Groups</b>: for smooth vertices belonging to more
		 unwrap groups. Each clone of the same vertex will have the same position, same normal, and a different uv coordinate for each unwrap group</li>
		<li><b>Equal to the Number of its Polygons</b>: for sharp vertices. Each clone of the same
		 vertex will have the same position, different normals evaluated on each polygon, and different uv coordinates when the vertex fall on different unwrap groups.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph"> An edge may have a maximum of 2 attached polygons (this is a very important constraint which makes everything work well), so the multiplicity of an edge, and of its internal handles, may be 1 or 2. Handles and edges may be duplicated (multiplicity becomes 2) when:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>The edge has two attached polygons and one of its vertices is sharp (so the edge itself is sharp).</li>		<li>The edge has two attached polygons and the two polygons belongs to two different unwrap groups.</li>	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> You can always control the final number of runtime vertices
	 and edges in the inspector inside the panel called <b>Curved Poly Statistics</b></p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Polygons Sides with more than one edge</h4>

	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">Polygons may have more sides. The minimum amount is 3 (triangular polygons) and you can have polygons with a maximum number of 8 sides</p>	

<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">Yes, you can make a polygon with 5 (pentagon) or more sides. That said, all the interpolation algorithms are optimized for the 3 sides (triangular) and the 4 sides (quadrilateral) cases, where the other cases are interpolated with a generic suboptimal solution. If you feel something is wrong, you can always cut your pentagons and hexagons into smaller quads or triangles by adding vertices and edges.</p>

	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">

		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 58</b> Polygons with sides which may have more than one edge and so more control points and more handles.</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">In the most simple case, each side of a polygon will be made of
	 an edge. That said, a polygon side may be done of a chain of subsequent aligned edges. Here <b>aligned</b> means that the handles of the two edges must lay on the same straight line: it is not necessary (yet recommended) that you have an <a
	 href="#handlesalignments">alignment</a> on them.</p>
	

<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">Sides with more edges will give you a greater modeling flexibility, but at the same time they will make more complex the interpolation pattern of the polygon. It something goes wrong, you may always add some edge or some vertex to take more control of interpolation schemas. </p>	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">During interpolation, the edges of a side made of more
	 than one edge will be tessellated separately, each one with its tessellation hints. For this reason, that side of the polygon risks to have an eccessive amount of segments and you should spend some time in the <a
	 href="#tessellationoperator">Tessellation Operator</a> to give each edge a better hints assignment.

<p class="guideparagraph"> This operator contains functions which can be used to automatically generate uv coordinates (unwraps) for your needs. The general way to use the operator should always follow this steps.</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>(A)Select a Geometry</b> : you can do this with the Geometries Inspector, which is the
		 same used also in <a href="geometriesoperator">Geometries Operator</a></li>
		<li><b>(B)Select a Group of Polygons</b> : here you will use the same approach and instruments

		 polygons belonging to the actually selected geometry can be selected</b> in this way. You
		 can still select other polygons using actions like <b>Select All</b> or <b>Grow</b>, but the
		 operator will only affect selected polygons belonging to the selected Geometry.</li>
		<li><b>(C)Choose an Unwrap Function</b> : when you select a function, an instance of it will
		 be added to actually selected geometry. The function will contain one or more unwrap groups, generated from the polygons you have selected in a way which depends on the function. </li>
		<li><b>(D)Fix the Unwrap Function parameters</b> : an Unwrap Function has many parameters,
		 which can be controlled after you have generated it. You may change and recall (reset) the Unwrap Function and its parameters more times before achieving a good unwrap or an unwrap which can be a good starting point before moving to the <a
		 href="#uvoperator">UV Operator</a>.</li>

		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 64</b>  The Unwraps Operator at work.</p>
	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">About this process, you should always keep in mind that:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>A Geometry can have one or more Unwrap Groups (this was previously explained in the chapter
		 about <a href="#uvoperator">UV Operator</a>).</li>
		<li>A Geometry can have one or more Unwrap Functions.</li>		<li>An Unwrap Function can have one or more Unwrap Groups. The list of Unwrap Groups in the Geometry is the sum of Unwrap Groups generated by its functions.</li>	</ul>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">So: there is a hierarchy involving Geometries, U.Groups and U.Functions.
	 You may find it a bit complex at the beginning, but you will find it pretty practical once you have used it a few times, especially because Unwrap Functions can be assigned and modified only in the <b>Unwrap
	 Operator</b> and they don't affect any other operator. They exist only to make it easier the
	 generation of Unwraps Groups. The key point here is that you can have more Functions for the same Geometry so that you can cut the geometry into different parts to apply a different unwrap function to each part, and this is very important when you need to unwrap complex geometries made of a lot of polygons and with irregular shapes.</p>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">There are 5 available unwrap functions:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/bisidedplanarunwrap.png"/><span
		 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Planar Unwrap (Bisided)</b>: Generates uv coordinates mapping 3D coordinates
		 on a plane. It is bisided, meaning that by default it will generate 2 Unwrap Groups, splitting the model into two halves watching the two sides of the plane. You can set it to 4 or 6 sides, to get 4 or 6 Unwrap Groups generated by cutting the model with respectively 2 or 3 planes. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/cylinderunwrap.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Cylinder
		 Unwrap</b>: Generates uv coordinates mapping 3D coordinates on a cylinder. By default it will
		 generate 2 Unwrap Groups, splitting the model into two halves watching the two sides of a reference plane containing the axis of the cylinder. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/sphereunwrap.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Spherical
		 Unwrap</b>: Generates uv coordinates mapping 3D coordinates on a sphere. By default it will
		 generate 2 Unwrap Groups, splitting the model into two halves watching the two sides of a reference plane passing through the center of the sphere. </li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/physicalunwrap.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Physical
		 Unwrap</b>: <b>This is an experimental function</b>. It is an improved version of Planar Unwrap
		 Bisided which takes into account the arc length of edges in 3D space to improve the edge shape in uv space.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/emptyunwrap.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Empty
		 Unwrap</b>: An Unwrap which doesn't assigne values, generating only one Unwrap Group. It's
		 the default function for imported parts or parts generated with the <b>Create Operator</b>.
		 If you press the button, you will get an unwrap with all uv coordinates assigned to 0 (zero).</li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5"> Unwrap Functions Parameters</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">The most important parameters of a Function are its center and
	 reference directions, which are used to control cutting planes. This parameters can be edited directly on a set of Handles which appears in the scene view: a white sphere is the center; a red line ending with a sphere is the first direction, and a green line ending with a sphere is the second direction. You can point on a sphere to access a <b>Move
	 Tool</b> to change its position. Around the frame made by the two directions you will see
	 2 (or more) yellow quads showing the sides of the unwrap functions, that is the reference used during the generation of each unwrap group. These parameters can be changed also with a menu. All these controls are available only after a Function has been generated or selected (to select a function, you need to look for it in the in-scene Geometries Inspector on the right).</p>


	<div class="guideparagraph  mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/unwraps/unwrapsframe.jpg"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 65</b>  The Unwraps Frame (center, directions and planes). Here other graphical elements visibility has been disabled.</p>
	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">Other parameters are:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Physical Size</b>: this parameter controls the rapport between distances in 3D space
		 and distances in uv space. This rapport can't be applied perfectly on unwrapped curved surfaces (this is a classical problem of unwrapping), but each unwrap function will work to do its best to get close to it. <img
		 class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/physicalunwrap.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Physical
		 Unwrap</b> has been designed to match <b>Physical Size</b> better than the others. </li>
		<li><b>Sides</b>: this parameter controls amount of Unwrap Groups generated by the function.
		 </li>
		<li><b>Overlap</b>: this parameter controls the way the unwrap groups are placed in uv space
		 If true, the groups will be overlapped, otherwise they will be placed at different position in uv-space. </li>
		<li><b>Margin</b>: this parameter is available only when overlap is false. It controls the
		 spacing between adjacent groups placed at different position in uv space. </li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">Most of these parameters will not affect directly the function until you Reset the Unwrap with one of this actions:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/bisidedplanarunwrap.png"/><img

		 class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/emptyunwrap.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Click
		 on any Unwrap Function</b>: You can change the unwrap function. The new function will keep
		 your parameters assignment, then will recompute the Unwrap.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/create/reset.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Reset
		 Unwrap</b>: recompute the unwrap taking into account any updated parameter in the Function.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/resetxy.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Unwrap
		 Frame on XY</b>: set the Unwrap Frame so that its directions become the x and y axis, than
		 it recomputes the unwrap.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/resetxz.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Unwrap
		 Frame on XZ</b>: set the Unwrap Frame so that its directions become the x and z axis, than
		 it recomputes the unwrap.</li>
		<li><img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/unwraps/resetyz.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Unwrap
		 Frame on ZX</b>: set the Unwrap Frame so that its directions become the y and z axis, than
		 it recomputes the unwrap.</li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5"> Keeping control other Unwrap Functions</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph"> There are a few things you can do to control your unwrap functions. </p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>After you create a new Unwrap Function</b>: the Operator will continue working on that
		 function, until you change your polygons selection. While the function is active, you will be able to change its parameters and even change the function type itself. All the groups for that function will be regenerated with your new function type and parameters.</li>
		<li><b>If you select a polygon which was previously unwrapped for a new unwrap function</b>:
		 it will be removed from the previous Unwrap Function, since each polygon can belong only to one unwrap function at a time. Eventually empty functions and groups will be removed from the geometry.</li>
		<li><b>If you select all polygons and create a new function</b>: all polygons will be moved
		 to the new function, so all previously generated functions and groups will be removed from the geometry (you can always Undo things). <b>This
		 is usefull if you want to remove all the unwraps or restart from scratch</b></li>
		<li><b>When generating a Function you don't have to select all polygons</b>: select the ones
		 you want to unwrap now with a specific function, you will be able to apply a second function on the other ones.</li>
		<li><b>When you want to load back a function to change some of its parameters</b>: you can
		 do this by pressing its <b>Select Function</b> button in the <b>Geometries Inspector</b>.</li>

	<p class="guideparagraph">The <b>Edit Operator</b> is by far the most complex Operator in
	 Curved Poly Maker. Its main goal is to create custom shapes, that you can subsequently reshape with any shaping tool. What makes this operator harder to use than others is that here you can customize shapes, generating new edges and new polygons and changing the relationships between them. This will force you to deal with aspects of Curved Polys which are completely hidden in other operators. </p>
	

<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">The number of editing tools is planned to grow in future releases, and that tools will be split into more separated Operators. The actual operator is a set of working things, yet it is part of a continuos development to find better ways and solutions for modeling with Curved Poly. </p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>(A)</b> Selection and Hiding Actions. Same as the ones on many other operators.</li>

	</ul>
	

<h4 id="editoperatormenu" class="guidetitle mt-5">Criticalities and Warnings</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">Some actions and operations available in this operator are pretty much complex and have been tested on many practical situations, yet you may find that your model gets broken if you experiment with them in ways which have not been even considered during development. Here some consideration we want to share with you before you get your models broken:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>You can find some examples of working uses of Edit Operator in this documentation. We are also sharing more through the website and through the youtube channel. Using the Edit Operator the way it is shown on these tutorials should be safe.</li>		<li>If you want to experiment a way to use the Edit Operator, make a test before breaking a model you have spent hours on.</li>		<li>Also: while making experiments you should learn to use the <b>Save New</b> button often.
		 You may rely on Undo, but when something gets broken its not guaranted the Undo will be able to safely roll back to the previous state of your model.</li>
		<li>If tutorials aren't enough and you have no idea how to get a specific result, you can ask for help at support.mushroomslabs.com. You will find a dedicated thread for this.</li>		<li>While editing it is much safer to avoid working on a model splitted into more geometries or with unwraps. If you are working on an imported or inserted model, you can use the geometries operator and the unwraps operator to clean the model from geometries and from unwraps you don't want. If you are working on primitives generated with the Create Operator, you should disable the separate and unwraps options (that is by default). If you create a model from scratch in the Edit Operator every new polygon will be generated on the same geometry without using unwraps. </li>		<li>If you plan to use often the Edit Operator, you should also spend time to understand how you can fix your models. Curved Polys are complex objects, and in many situations it may be that you see bugged features where instead you only have a bad setup of details like Handles, Editing Normals, Corners or Bindings. Most broken models can be fixed by taking control of this details with tools that you can find in the Edit Operator. </li>	</ul>
	

<h4 id="editoperatorselectandhiding" class="guidetitle mt-5">Selection and Hiding</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Here you will find common actions for selecting and hiding you
	 can also find in many other operators. As for other operators, you can use a <b>Rectangular
	 Selector</b> and a <b>Circular Selector</b> in <b>Full</b> or <b>Part</b> mode. You may check
	 the <a href="#selectionoperator">Selection Operator</a> and the <a href="#hidingoperator">Hiding
	 Operator</a> for more details about this options and actions.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Please. Take your time to ensure you know how and when to disable
	 options like <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/verticeshandles.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Vertices</b>, <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/edgeshandles.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Edges</b>, <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/handleshandles.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Handles</b>, <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/settings/polygonshandle.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Polygons</b>. While using this operator there are a lot of practical
	 situations in which its useful to simplify what is rendered in the view or which elements are interacting with selection tools. You can find more in the chapter <a
	 href="#userinterface">About User Interface and Settings</a></p>
	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"><b>Be careful about things hidden with the Hide Operator
	 or common Hide Actions</b>. When you work on your custom shapes, you need to select elements
	 before you can activate most of the tools. That said, most of the tools will work on elements you have selected but also to other elements which are connected (in many ways) to the ones you have selected. For instance, if you have selected a vertex, all the edges and handles and polygons attached to that vertex may be affected by the tools. <b>That
	 elements will be affected also when they are hidden</b>: hidden elements can't be targeted
	 directly by the tools since they don't contribute to selection while hidden, but they may change if they are linked to elements which are selected. You should plan carefully how you hide things, because there is the risk you don't see important changes happening in your model. </p>

<h1 id="customprimitives" class="guidetitle">Edit Operator - Making Custom Primitives</h1>	
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3">Edit Operator requires <b>Curved Poly - Maker</b></p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Apart from the shapes you can generate with the <b>Create Operator</b>,
	 you can use the <b>Edit Operator</b> to generate new primitives or parts for you models in
	 many ways. There are many approaches you can follow here:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>(A)Generate Edges and Make Polygons</b>: you can create a model from scratch by modeling
		 Edges (or Lines or Vertices) in the scene view. With two selected vertices you can also generate Circles. Once a you have a good set of edges and vertices you can fill it with polygons with the <b>Make
		 Polygons</b> button which will guess the best polygons to fill your net of edges. <b>Make
		 Polygons</b> take into accounts all the constraints required to make interpolation processes
		 work well, so that the final mesh extracted from the polygons looks good.</li>
		<li><b>(B)Modify a Shape with Cuts and Extensions</b>: you can start from a primitive or model
		 you already have and delete parts you don't need with Canceling Buttons. With one vertex selected, you can also create a hole; when you have an hole (either generated after removing contents or with the Hole Operation) you can exploit the Extrude Path or the Hole Joints operations to add polygons to your shape. </li>
		<li><b>(C)Add Control Vertices</b>: the best tool to add vertices (and edges and polygons)
		 to a shape you already have is the <b>Subdivide Edge Operation</b>. This operation works on
		 one edge at a time and allows you to split it into two halves. You may then extend it to adjacent polygons and to more edges in the case the polygons are quads. If you need something more specific which can't be accomplished with that operation, you can also rework parts of you shape by removing polygons or edges and using Put Edges + Make Polygons to generate different parts and details. </li>
		<li><b>(D)Combining and Stitching Shapes together</b>: you can take two (or more) shapes of
		 your choice and put them together in the same model. You can do this by using the <b>Create
		 Operator</b>, or you can also duplicate parts in the <b>Edit Operator</b>. Then, if they have
		 an open part (eventually one generated with cutting tools), you can try to stitch/weld them together. You have more alternative ways to do so. One approach is to use <b>Remove
		 Doubles</b> which also weld edges when their shape is approximative the same. Another solution
		 is to take select two open also facing each other and go for <b>Bridge Joints</b>. You can
		 also use Put Edges and Make Polygons to manually build a custom Joint between two holes in two separated surfaces. </li>
		<li><b>(E)Import a LOW POLY Mesh and Use Fixing Tools to Transform it into a Curved Poly</b>:
		 be sure to have the time to understand all the passages and the use of fixing tools. The mesh must be have a very low amount of faces, since each face will be transformed into a Curved Poly Polygon.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">Here we will show a few examples of all this approaches. You can also look for Curved Poly tutorials online to learn more. Here an index of the examples:</p>

	 Tool</b> to position it. When you add vertices with <b>Put Edges</b> a vertex position will
	 be computed taking into account the mouse position and the depth of the pivot from the scene view camera perspective. So, for instance, if you place the pivot in (0,0,-1.5) and you choose to align the scene view Camera to X-Y axis (that is with the back and front view), every vertex generated with Put Edges will have a z coordinate equal to -1.5, and x and y coordinates computed from mouse position.</p>

	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Put Edges</b> has been activated you will be able to add vertices
	 by clicking on the scene view. An edge will be generated between two consecutive edges, generating a continuous piecewise curve. You can break the sequence and start a new one by pressing <b>Space</b>,
	 or you can also <b>Apply</b> and re-enter pressing <b>Put Edges</b> again.</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"><i>If you position your mouse on any existent vertex</i>
	, its look will change: in this case <b>Put Edges</b> will re-use that vertex instead of generating
	 a new one: you can exploit this to connect each vertex with more than two edges, so that you can create a complete net of edges. When a vertex is smooth and it has already more edges attached, new edges may be reshaped to conform (automatically) smoothness conditions for that vertex.</p>
	

<h3 class="guideparagraph">Making Polygons</h3>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Once you have a net of Edges you can start generating polygons.
	 To do so you first need to select at least a vertex: Curved Poly will generate polygons by looking for any closed loop of edges nearby your selected vertices. Then: you only have to press <img
	 class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/edit/makepolygons.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Make
	 Polygons</b> and everything is automatic. A faster approach is to press <b>Select All</b>,
	 and then <b>Make Polygons</b>, in this way any possible polygon available in the model will

	. 
	
	<p class="backcolor-primary-1 p-3"> You may need to practice a bit with this before being
	 able to use correctly <b>Make Polygons</b>. There are situations in which polygons can't be
	 generated because there are edges with a bad shape, or with overlapping handles, which are blocked by Curved Poly to avoid issues with interpolation algorithms. When you think you did good but your polygons couldn't be generated, you can try go through an inspecting and fixing process. This is explained more in deep in a <a

	<p class="guideparagraph">This chapter covers mainly the process of inspecting and fixing
	 a model on which <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/edit/makepolygons.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Make Polygons</b> is failing. This happens because there are strong
	 constraints on polygons, and it may be hard to know when something is wrong at a first glance. We will also cover other situations in which your model may look broken or un-editable, trying to give you some way to exit from this bad situations.</p>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Corners</h4>

	<div class="guideparagraph w-50 mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">
			<img class="rounded w-100" src="images/ief/corners.jpg"></img>
		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 95</b>  Corners on the edges which are attached to the same vertex. The Editing normal is used to determine which edges make a corner.</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">A Corner is a connection between two edges attached to the same
	 vertex. On each edge, not all possible edges couples will be used to generate a corner: the <b>Editing
	 Normal</b> on the vertex is used as a reference to give the edges an order; after ordering
	 the edges, a corner will be generated only between two consecutive edges. If the angle between two edges is greater than 180°, the corner will be skipped. If the angle is approximately 180°, a special corner will be generated which can be used only to generate polygons having sides with more than one edge (a corner with approximately 180° can't become a polygon corner, but it can still be used to generate the borders of the polygon)</p>
	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">You can see the corners on each vertex by activating the <img class="backcolor-complement-0"
	 src="images/edit/cornersoption.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Show Corners</b> option.
	 The corners are candidate to become corners for a polygon generated with <b>Make Polygons</b>;
	 corners exist before polygons, so you need correct corners to make a correct polygon. If you think the corners has not been computed correctly, you may have some problem either with the handles (edges) or with the Editing Normals. We will see now two separated situations and how to fix things.</p>
	

<h3 class="guideparagraph">Fixing Corners on a Smooth Vertex </h3>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> On smooth vertices things are a bit more easy,because of the constraints
	 between the handles and the editing normals. If you think a corner is wrong, you must check all your handles directions around that corner. You can do this by either accessing the <b>Change
	 Handles</b> in the <b>Edit Operator</b> or switching to the <b>Pointings Operator</b> (<b>Change
	 Handles</b> is a simplified version of the <b>Pointings Operator</b> with no menus). What
	 you have to do is to point the handles (one by one) and change the Roll, the yellow arrow.</p>

		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">

		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 96</b>  Fixing Handles on a Smooth Vertex to change the corners. Here you need to drag the yellow arrow (the Roll) to recompute corners.</p>
	</div>

	

<h3 class="guideparagraph">Fixing Corners on a Sharp Vertex </h3>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph"> On sharp vertices things are more complex. Depending on the direction
	 of your handles, actions like <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/edit/fixnormals.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Fix Normals</b> may compute an editing normal on the vertex which
	 is not what you wish to have. Since handles can go in any direction there is not a unique way to assign a normal which make sense on a vertex. And there is not a unique configuration of corners which make sense. So, if you don't like the way corners as been generated you can change it by changing the editing normal. To do so, you need to enter <b>Change
	 Handles</b> in the <b>Edit Operator</b> (in <b>Pointings Operator</b> can't be changed freely,
	 so here you have only one option). You need to point a vertex first, then you need to drag the little sphere on top of the Editing Normal with your mouse: you will, eventually, see a complete reconfiguration of your corners around the normal. Technically speaking (if you can understand this): Curved Poly will recompute corners by ordering first the edges on the plane orthogonal to the normal; changing the normal will change the plane and therefore the edges order. </p>

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Edge Bindings and Polygons Matches</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Edge bindings are connections between corners, computed through
	 edges. You can see edge bindings by activating the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/edit/bindingsoption.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Bindings</b> option, but you have to activate the <img class="backcolor-complement-0"
	 src="images/edit/cornersoption.png"/><span class="mr-2"/></span><b>Corners</b> option first.
	 They are drawn as blue curves.</p>

		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 98</b>  An Edge Binding on a single Edge on the left. An Edge binding through more edges on the right.</p>
	</div>

	

<p class="guideparagraph">An edge binding can be made of one edge, if the edge starts and end with acute corners. When an edge has a corner with and angle of almost 180°, the binding will step to the other edge putting more edges together.</p>

	<div class="guideparagraph w-50 mt-5 mb-5" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		<div class="w-100" style="border:2px solid black;">

		</div>
		<p class="guideparagraph p-2" style="border:2px solid black;"> <b>Fig. 99</b>  4 Bindings and the Perfect Match for a Curved Quad.</p>
	</div>

	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">When, starting from a corner and following the bindings, Curved
	 Poly can get back to the starting corner, we have a closed loop of corners connected by bindings which becomes a <b>Polygon
	 Match</b>. These matches are used to generate polygons, and this is the reason why you need
	 to correct corners every time you find vertices which can't generate polygons. </p>

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Selection Inspector</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">You can activate the <img class="backcolor-complement-0" src="images/edit/inspectoption.png"/><span
	 class="mr-2"/></span><b>Selection Inspector</b> to inspect any selected element in you model.
	 The inspector shows:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Vertices</b>: the list of selected vertices. Each vertex is numbered.You can activate
		 <b>Vertices Edges</b>, <b>Vertices Polygons</b> and <b>Vertices Corners</b> to have the sublist
		 of (respectively) edges, polygons and corners attached to each vertex. </li>
		<li><b>Edges</b>: the list of selected edges. Each edges is numbered. Between square brackets,
		 you will find the indices of the vertices at the extremes of each edge. You can activate <b>Edges
		 Polygons</b> and <b>Edges Corners</b> to have the sublist of (respectively) polygons and corners
		 attached to each edge. (Remember that an edge can have a maximum of two polygons, here called the Front Polygon and the Back Polygon, and a maximum of 4 corners)</li>
		<li><b>Polygons</b>: the list of selected polygons. Each polygon is numbered. Between square
		 brackets, you will find the indices of the vertices at the corners of the polygons.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">Inspecting selected contents may help you understand in depth serious issues in the relationships between your elements. For example you may find that you attached an edge to the wrong vertex, or you may find a polygon is connecting vertices that you didn't want to connect because of a bad disposition of corners. </p>	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Other Fixes which can help you</h4>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">Here a few more fixes not related to <b>Make Polygons</b> which
	 can help you exit from some rare bad situations. With my best wishes that you never fall in them.</p>
	

<h3 class="guideparagraph">Broken Edges</h3>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">When you use unwrapped surfaces it may happen that something goes
	 wrong in the relationships between edges and unwraps, compromising the structure of runtime curved polys. If you see one or more edges change their vertices for no reason, it may be because of this. What you should do is to move to Geometry Operator and Reset Geometries. Then, go to the Unwraps Operator, select everything and press on <b>Empty
	 Unwrap</b>. This will reset all unwrap groups, potentially removing the issue. You should
	 always execute Edit Operations first and separate geometries and compute unwraps at a second time.</p>
	

<h3 class="guideparagraph">Lost Editor Asset</h3>	
	
	<p class="guideparagraph">You may have lost your editor asset if you haven't followed the
	 tips in chapter <a href="#assetsandlibraries">Assets and Libraries</a>: you can still recover
	 your model. Do this:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>import your model in a new Curved Poly.</li>		<li>Go to Geometries Operator and Clean Geometries.</li>		<li>Go to Unwraps Operator and Remove Unwraps with <b>Empty Unwrap</b>.</li>
		<li>Go to the Edit Operator, select All and press <b>Remove Doubles</b>. The default distance
		 should be enough to remove duplicated vertices which may happen after a re-import of a runtime model. </li>
		<li>Save or Save as new. Now you will have a copy of your shape with its own editor asset. You will have to re-unwrap the shape if it had uv coordinates. </li>	</ul>
	

<h3 class="guideparagraph">Messed Polygons</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>Select all polygons.</li>		<li>Cancel Polygons.</li>		<li>Make Polygons.</li>		<li>You can try also: Double Click on Flip Polygons (this will force a few controls on polygons and normals which may help) </li>	</ul>
	

<h3 class="guideparagraph">Frozen Interface or Operator</h3>	

<p class="guideparagraph">If your interface is not answering, it may be your model is in a broken state which makes something fail so badly that curved poly can't even draw or activate the user interface correctly. Because of this you may miss some important controls in the Scene View, making impossible for you to execute some actions. If this is the case you can try:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>UNDO</b>: sometimes and undo can make miracles. Sometimes you need more than one undo.</li>
		<li><b>Don't Save in the inspector, Create a new Curved Poly and Import the previous model.</b>:
		 this will reload in a fresh Curved Poly the last Saved Edit Version of your model.</li>
		<li><b>Save in the inspector, Create a new Curved Poly and re Import</b>: this may help recover
		 the content of your model. </li>
	</ul>
	

<h4 class="guidetitle mt-5">Fix Operator</h4>	

<p class="guideparagraph">With Fix Operator you can check your models for potential issues and, eventually, take actions to solve the issues. Actually you can only:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Inspect</b>: to find out potential issues.</li>
		<li><b>Remove Broken Alignments</b>: remove broken alignments from the model.</li>
	</ul>
	

<p class="guideparagraph">More actions are coming with future releases.</p></div>
