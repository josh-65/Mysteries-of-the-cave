These materials are tools for modeling.

They are designed to help you see the reflections on the surfaces you are shaping.

Note: Curved Poly will load by default a mat named 'Bisided Normals Mat' to each new Curved Poly generated in scene.
By default 'Bisided Normals Mat' is a mat which works only with the standard pipeline. 
If you wish to use other unity pipelines you need either to:
- Change the default Mat to use the 'NormalsShader_PBR' shader, which is a Shader Graph material.
- Rename 'Bisided Normals Mat' to something else and rename 'Bisided Normals Mat_PBR' to 'Bisided Normals Mat'

You are free to customize the default material with everything else you like.
