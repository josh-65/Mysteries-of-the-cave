These shaders are tools for modeling.

They are designed to help you see the reflections on the surfaces you are shaping.

(Check Assets/CurvedPoly/Assets/Materials for some examples)

Note: NormalsShader is the Standard Pipeline Version. NormalsShader_PBR is the Shader Graph version. 
You need to choose which one will work with your pipeline. 
Check the premade materials and read the ReadMe available at 'CurvedPoly/Assets/Materials'
