These two libraries contain 80+ sample models and primitives, mostly unwrapped, which were all made with Curved Poly Maker.
They are here both to improve your experience with Curved Poly Shape Editor and to show you what you can do with Curved Poly Maker.

Here a list of HOW TOs related to library. If you need something more, ask it at http://support.mushroomslabs.com.

1) How to use one of the Models in the Library.

     - Select it from the Project Panel.
	 - Click on 'Add to Scene'
	 - Once in the scene, click on 'Save New' (we haven't add  here a control to avoid overwriting of elements in the library,
	 so if you don't 'Save New' you will overwrite the original model)	 

2) How to copy the content of a Library

	- Choose a folder. 
	- In the Project Panel, activate the Popup Menu and Click on 'Create -> Curved Poly -> Curved Poly Asset Library'
	- Give the new Library a name you can remember.
	- Get back to the library containing the elements you want to copy. Select all of them.
	- In the Inspector, click 'Copy Into Library'.
	- Select the Library you create in the first steps. Curved Poly will create a correct copy of all the assets in the new library.
	
Note: 'Copy Into Library' works with any Curved Poly Asset, either the ones in a library or the standalone ones you created with 'Save' or 'Save new'


3) Moving Libraries in another folder for further editing.

	Each library has an associated folder named 'Editor' which contains a file with all the Editor Assets. 
	The Editor Assets are necessary for Curved Poly Editors to work, and they are discarded at runtime.
	If you move a library and you want to go on editing its assets you also need to move its associated Editor Assets.
	Or: you can create a copy of the library  (Point 2) in a new location and delete the original one in the previuos location.
	
	If you don't do this: once you open an asset missing its Editor counterpart curved poly Editors will try to regenerate it.
	Sadly: the regeneration process is not perfect and it will fail on unwrapped models or models with sharp vertices. 
	This is better explained in the documentation.
	
4) Moving Libraries in another folder to use at Run Time.

	(Read point 3 first)
	If you don't need to further edit a library, you don't need to move the Editor Assets,
	But to avoid assets breaking you need to disable Curved Poly Editors first.
	To do so: look for 'CurvedPoly/Editor/Plyugins/CPBaseEditor.dll' and Exclude the 'Editor' Platform.
	
	If you are working in a team and there are people which need only the runtime features of Curved Poly they will need:
		- The 'CurvedPoly/Plugins' folder (containing the 2 runtime dlls).
		- Any Curved Poly Asset, with or without their editing counterparts.
		- Any Curved Poly Assets Library, with or without their editing counterparts.
	The Editing CounterParts can be copied or not, since once you remove or disable the 'CurvedPoly/Editor/Plyugins/CPBaseEditor.dll'
	library they will be ignored by Unity even in Edit Mode.
